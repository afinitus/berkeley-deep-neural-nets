Leonardo DiCaprio in a fit of rage begins to torpedo his own career by deliberately acting poorly and taking on bad films . He finally wins an oscar for starring in Paul Blart : Mall Cop 3 . [/INST] The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . Last night was bad . He gathered that . His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories . He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort . <newline> He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was . His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up . <newline> There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself . It was a game he 'd play with himself , glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back . If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman , or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling . <newline> His face was portly and unshaven , in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard . His stomach was round but firm , like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated . The hair was long and unruly , receding far into the past . But his eyes were the giveaway . Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity . It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger . Still sharp enough to cut . <newline> `` DiCaprio . '' The curse rasped out of him in a choke . After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there . Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there . He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done , but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money . Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him . <newline> Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor . <newline> His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room . <newline> <newline> The window was smashed . He looked at the bottle , confused . No , he had n't done that . At least not with the vodka . He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth . <newline> <newline> The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place .

[/INST] It 's been three days since my boyfriend pissed off the neighbors . <newline> <newline> They had to be pissed , he called the police on them . The neighbors had been harboring a runaway criminal . We did n't live in a bad neighborhood , there were families and good people living here with solid steady jobs . They cared about their yards and such . But , there was a bad egg , our neighbors to the south of us were shady . We could hear them yelling at their dog many times a week . Strange smoke often came out of their house , and the lights in the garage were on at odd hours . We never had proof until now that our concerns are legitimate . <newline> <newline> The car the escaped criminal was driving had been parked at the neighbor 's house and my boyfriend decided he should turn them in . This lead to the police parking in front of *our* house , and watching them through our bedroom window for hours until they caught him . They had to know it was us . And it freaked me out . <newline> <newline> I had started tucking my pink taser in my jacket pocket when I took my miniature Yorkie out to go potty . My neighbor to the north , Jay , seemed to notice my tension , so when he saw me step outside , he 'd come out and chat with me . He 'd ask me about work , and talk to me about his latest construction jobs . Jay always pretend to be grabbing something out of his massive pick-up truck . It usually followed the same pattern - he grabs something out of his truck , sees me out with my dog , then starts in on how it baffles him how such a tiny dog was smarter than most of the people he worked with . We 'd both gripe about our jobs and laugh about stupid customers , chase the puppy down when she tried to go after squirrels , and then part ways until the next potty break . <newline> <newline> The sun was beginning to set when my dog started doing her potty dance by the door . I put on my jacket , slipped my taser in my pocket , and opened the door . She bolted out the door and went straight for the squirrel sniffing around the sidewalk . <newline> <newline> `` NO ! BAD GIRL , COME HERE ! '' The squirrel started running across the road and her tiny legs skittered out of it . I ran after her , swearing as I tripped over a crack in the road . I felt a snap in my ankle and I went down . <newline> <newline> The roar of a large pick-up engine was too close and I did n't know what to look at - my little dog bouncing across the neighbor 's lawn , or the tires that were n't slowing down fast enough .

Over it went , blocking the door . He knelt at the safe set under his desk , opposite the door . <newline> <newline> There was a pounding at the door , a shoulder slamming into it .

[/INST] It was dark and Levi was pretty sure he was lying on his back . There was firelight flickering off of what was left of a ceiling . He could hear something but it was muffled . He was almost positive it was screaming . When he tried to move he felt an excruciating pain in his left side that caused him to cry out . His hand moved to it instinctively and found something protruding from the wound . It seemed to be a pipe of some kind . He attempted to pull it out but it was covered in blood making it slick . <newline> <newline> Levi 's ears began ringing and the sounds began to become clearer , it felt quite a bit like some one was driving needles into his eardrums . The sounds he was hearing were definitely screams and not just one person 's , a lot of people were screaming or yelling . There was some one close to him that was crying . He looked in the direction of the tears and seen his sister kneeling beside him , her hands covering her face . <newline> <newline> `` What happened Laur ? '' He was shocked at the sound that barely rasped out from between his lips . His sister 's hands jerked down and she stared down at Levi with a shocked look on her face . `` bu ... I tho ... you were n't breathing ! '' What started as a whisper ended in yell as she threw her self across her brother and began to sob anew . Levi cried out hoarsely but she did n't hear . She just continued to cling to him like a little girl that had just found her lost doll . <newline> <newline> He put one of his arms around her and scanned the room as much as he could . It looked like a warzone , like something out of one of the many shooters in his gaming collection . `` What the hell ? '' There were dead bodies everywhere , he recognized some of them . There were firefighters and EMT 's running around trying to find survivors in the rubble . Most of the screams were coming from survivors . <newline> <newline> He seemed to be laying on top of the bottom of a desk , and he was pretty sure the pipe sticking out of his side was a actually one of the legs . Then he spotted it lying about two feet from his right leg , a round section of desk about the size of a softball . On it was a round symbol with geometric shapes glowing with dark red embers and a dull tendril of smoke rising up from it . It all came back to him in rush . <newline> <newline> He drew that in his notebook . It was second period and his trig teacher had this monotonous voice that could put a crack head to sleep . Laurana caught him doodling and had thrown a pencil at him to scold him silently , which made him jerk as he was connecting the last line on his drawing . Then there was the light and the heat and lastly the dark . Did he do this ? What the hell was going on here ? <newline> <newline> A voice brought him out of his little flashback . `` Sir . Sir ?

The further away it is , the longer you have left to live . Every day it inches a little bit closer , but it is always there . Except yours , which disappeared three weeks ago [/INST] So this is where it had all led him . The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape , painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues , colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected , bouncing around the skies aimless and endless , purposeless , never to rest , and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout , pensive . Many things ran through his mind ; his shitty job , his hateful parents , the loss of his wife , the only person he 'd ever truly loved . But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so . <newline> <newline> To most people , a reaper was a curse : a constant reminder that death was always there , waiting . An undeniable proof that no one lives forever , and everyone will die sooner than they think . The closer it was , the sooner you would die . <newline> <newline> Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements , they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified . This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying ; as their reapers got closer , no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at . They called them Death Profits : a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved . The diamond guillotine , the snake oil supplements , the guided meditation and isolation , even the hyper-boosted trips to space ; nothing could rid a person of their reaper . <newline> <newline> Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever . When his wife was killed in the car crash , Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes , his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind . In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter* , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . <newline> <newline> His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing . What could Ray do ? *WHAT COULD HE DO ? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind . *Prevent it somehow . Change fate . Swerve off the road . Offer your life as collateral . Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! * <newline> <newline> She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew** , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back . Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly , unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear . The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light , the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other . Her soft lips just beginning to form his name , asking him to protect her , save them , keep her safe : his wife , the mother of his child , his only love and the only thing he ever loved , *save us Ray , save our baby* and yet he failed her , just as with everything else , he failed her too and her would never forgive himself . <newline> <newline> *Remember , Ray . Memorize it . Remember what you did . Never forget . * <newline> <newline> Just before the impact he could not find his reaper . He knew what was coming and he did not want to live , without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die . But his reaper was not there . It was not there and then the impact came , his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood , theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car . <newline> <newline> She had gone through the windshield . There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her , cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle . His ears were ringing . As he failed to stand , he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly . He tried the door but it would n't budge . He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might , the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle . Nothing . He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass , and then felt a ghastly chill . <newline> <newline> It was passing through him . Her reaper . Bony arms outstretched , wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque destiny . He thought his heart stopped . He could n't move . And then he raced to her , that white smudge on the concrete , falling to his knees and pulling her into his lap , her sweater curiously untouched except where his bloody fingers colored it red . He willed her eyes to open , wanting to wake her more than anything , wanting to have one more day with her , one more hour , one more look into those eyes , one more kiss . She was scarcely breathing . Her hand was limp in his . <newline> <newline> He tried to speak , but all that came out was an anguished sob . The reaper was only feet away now . He had seconds . <newline> `` Please ! '' he sobbed to nothing and no one . `` Please , please , god , take me instead , leave her . Take me ! '' There was no answer . The damned thing was n't even 5 feet away now . He lifted her into his arms and tried to run . His boat shoes had long since flown off , and the broken glass crunched deeply into his feet . He hobbled along , unwilling to accept the inevitable . Looking over his shoulder he saw the reaper keeping its grim pace , arms outstretched and dead eyes unseeing . <newline> <newline> `` Damn you ! '' he snarled , as he struggled onwards . `` Damn you , you -- you fucking monster ! You *freak* ! Fuck you , fuck you , I 'll kill you somehow , I swear it , please do n't , please -- '' and as his threats devolved into pleas he slipped , falling to his knees . He gave up . It was done . He had made it barely 10 feet . There was nothing left he could do . Faintly , he heard the baby crying . The reaper came on . It had never fallen behind . Finally it reached them and gently , gently , took her soul in its arms , its bony limbs passing through Ray 's own , and disappeared . In Ray 's arms , his wife let out her last breath . <newline> <newline> He was finished . He wished fervently to die right there . And then he realized where he was kneeling . Gently he laid his wife on the ground , clearing away the debris . He laid his last kiss on her bloody forehead , then stood . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped on the running board of the delivery vehicle and opened the drivers side door . Almost comically , out clanked several beer cans , *one , two , three* . Inside the cab of the white box truck was a very clearly inebriated man . He stared wide-eyed at the destruction he had caused . Ray grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out roughly to the pavement . <newline> <newline> The man fell hard on his face . He looked up , arms raised . <newline> `` Look man , I 'm sorry , '' he began . `` I -- I do n't know what happened , it just -- '' Ray began beating him . With every punch he imagined he was killing himself . Tears streamed down his face . Every strike drove shards of glass deeper into his hands . He focused on the pain and ignored the man 's steadily weakening pleas . When the man raised his arms to defend himself , Ray kicked him viciously until he felt bones in his feet break . Then he began punching him again . <newline> <newline> Out of the corner of his eye , Ray noticed something . There was a reaper creeping nearer . He was beginning to tire , but with every punch he threw , the harbinger of death jolted closer . Finally , he had to stop , exhausted and panting , doubling over , hands pouring blood all over his knees . The man was a gory mess ; nose broken , face swollen , making small mewling noises between gasps for air through his bloodied mouth . A few of his teeth had fallen out . <newline> <newline> The man 's reaper was a few feet away now . 15 , 20 maybe . Ray caught his breath for some moments , then plodded with red-ribboned feet over to a piece of curb that had been broken free by the crash . He lifted it above his head with his tortured hands and brought it down on the defenseless man once , twice , three times , each with a sickening `` *thunk* . '' With every blow the reaper reappeared closer , and as the man 's skull broke open from the final strike , it embraced his body with its arms and then lifted off , disappearing with his soul , leaving the expired shell behind . <newline> <newline> Ray had no tears left . He crawled over to his wife 's body and held her in his lap , stroking her hair , staring into the flames of the burning car as the sirens grew closer . The baby stopped crying . </s>\n","<s>[INST] A person with a high school education gets sent back into the 1600s and tries to explain science and technology to the people .

[/INST] I 've always had trouble deciding whether to help someone or not . I 'm always worried that I 'll be cumbersome while I help someone , so I tend to ignore the needs of others . It 's something that I 'm actively working on , and one of my main inspirations for improving my speed of assistance comes from this story that happened to me . <newline> <newline> I lived in Hong Kong back when I was a kid - out in the New Territories ( the 'rural ' area ) , and would take the bus home from school . The public transportation was and still is fantastic , so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home . When I got to the nearest station to my home , I began to walk towards the subway tunnel , which led to the pathway to my house . The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees , and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path . The path extended past this sort of village place , then went on towards a cul-de-sac . The cul-de-sac was where I lived , and took about an hour to get to . It was a long but nice walk . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area , and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ) . At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs ' barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog . Today though , I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me . First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it , since I did n't have enough space to go around . But when I actually got to the point of doing the act , I stopped . It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave . So I turned around and began to walk back . But then I heard growling behind me . <newline> <newline> Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it 's tail by accident ) , and it was mad at me . So , faced with the danger of being bitten , and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up , I chose flight and began to run . Of course , my stubby legs could n't outrun the fully grown dog , and it caught up to me quickly . Realising the situation I was in , I decided to turn around and fight the dog . So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand , but instead got it caught in the dog 's mouth . Fear of the dog was n't ruling me anymore , and I bit the dog back . Dog whimpers and runs away , but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home . I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though . <newline> <newline> So I began to walk home . But about five to ten minutes after I began walking , I met a nanny ( they 're pretty common in Hong Kong ) . She had headgear , so she was from Indonesia . She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries . When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me . I was an expat 's child though and did n't understand . She then dropped her little trolley , and lifted me up in both of her arms . She stuttered out the words , `` Come with me , I have bandaids . '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway . She lived in the village that the path passed by , and so only took a minute or so to reach . She brought me into her employer 's house and sat me down . She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said , `` Parents . '' Then she went into another room while I called my parents . <newline> <newline> I told my mom what happened , she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car . The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol , some paper towels , and those long white , wrapping bandages . She wiped off the blood that caked my hand , and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol . She honestly added too much in my opinion . It honestly stung more than the bite ... Anyways , she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents . My parents arrived , and I left . <newline> <newline> I guess some people might say everything the nanny did was expected , and that anyone would do such a thing . But she could have easily ignored me , and that 's what I probably would have done : I would think the person does n't want my help because that person is n't asking . The nanny 's speed of reaction , and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind . Even if what she did was minimal . She was just 'someone 's in trouble - > must help . ' Nothing was in between the two motions , and I want to remember that . </s>\n","<s>[INST] In your favourite fictional universe , the villain won . It 's one year later .

He started jogging through the corridors of the Death Star . Everyone he passed gave him more room than they would anyone else . Luke sensed their fear , and smiled . Soldiers should fear their commanders ; it was the right way of things . Position alone does not give one the right to lead . Excellence alone is not a reason to be followed . If you intend to rule , your subordinates must see your strength , and submit to it . Anyone who thought differently was either misinformed or simply a fool . The regional governors in this meeting will be both . <newline> <newline> Luke sighed as he considered the conversation to come . It will be the same as the one with the Rebel leaders . Well almost the same . The Rebel leaders were so surprised to see Luke standing alongside his father that they did not speak for a long time . And when they did , they were so held back that the meeting accomplished nothing . His father had tried to explain to them that things would be better now . The injustice in Galaxy stemmed from Emperor Palpatine alone . Together , the two Skywalkers would lead the Galaxy to true peace . They did not believe him , but they will come around . Leia did not attend . <newline> <newline> Leia . The thought of her pushed Luke ’ s thoughts in a different direction . He felt an old pull , remembering Leia , Han , Chewie . R2 and 3PO . And old Ben . He did not like to think about them . He had done what was necessary to save their Galaxy . They were never in his position . When you are weak , you can never understand the decisions the powerful must make . And live with . They too , will one day understand . The power Luke and his father have together . They can make things the way they want them to be . As always , this line of thought led frustratingly nowhere , so he pushed it from his mind to focus on the upcoming meeting . <newline> <newline> This meeting with the regional governors , only a few years removed from being Senators , would be unbearable . Even before he joined his father , Luke had hated politicians . What an egregious waste of time ! Petty fools , arguing over nothing but pride ! There were precious few , Leia ’ s late father among them , who governed for the good of their people . Leia . No , she was not to be thought of . Luke pushed the thought away more powerfully than before . Focus on the governors . They will be weak . They will ask for things they do not need , for power they do not deserve . Their existence is an unfortunate by-product of the size of the Galaxy , nothing more . They will be short-sighted ; incapable of understanding the great things Luke and his Father can accomplish together ! <newline> <newline> And accomplish great things they will ! As the only two force users left , they can lead the Galaxy to a rich a prosperous future ! And as Luke ’ s father ages , they will seek out Leia and Han , for their child will be tied to the force as Luke and his Father are . Leia ’ s son will be the next in line to learn the ways of the Force from Luke . They will use their family ’ s talents to rule the Galaxy for centuries to come . <newline> <newline> Finally , Luke reached the conference room .

What happens next ? [/INST] My name is Dr. Tel'Vara Troperras , and I will recount the tale of the Breach that changed our world . <newline> <newline> I remember when the Fourth Wall came down . I was in my living room , browsing people 's artistic creations on my 55 '' HDTV , when my screen became an infintitely long hallway , much like when you face two mirrors towards each other . From within came the sound of elephants , clashing of swords , and all manner of rainforest wildlife . <newline> <newline> I wisely jumped out of the way before they came out , destroying half my house . <newline> <newline> The most logical thing to do was alert my friends to this bloody awesome scene , and then call the insurance company and police . However , the network was being swamped ; everyone else was thinking the same thing , as it was happening in their living rooms as well ! <newline> <newline> Reports started coming in : people dressed in strange costumes , talking strange languages . There were mutated creatures and high-energy explosions throughout the globe , which were thankfully confined to sparsely-populated desert and mountainous regions . <newline> <newline> No one really put two and two together until they saw a wizard , with a lightning bolt for a scar , casting a thunderbolt in Trafalgar square . Or until a battallion of pointy-eared fair folk were found in a national park , speaking a foreign yet vaguely familiar language . <newline> <newline> Either there was a global convention , or the world of fiction merged with ours . <newline> <newline> The Breach has no physical form . There was no crater formed on impact , nor a collision trajectory viewable from space . Rather than coming from the outside , it seemed to have come from the inside , through the mediums we used to craft those worlds : books , pens , tablets , and even paintings were gates and keys . <newline> <newline> Half the world did n't know what to do . <newline> <newline> The other half , we of the younger generations , knew exactly what to do . <newline> <newline> Every creative writer and artist became an architect . With their tools at hand , they could summon forth fantastic creatures , and rearrange a piece of the world to their own image . Art and words became their spell circles and incantations . Brush and pen became their wands . <newline> <newline> We discovered that how big a person 's alterations could be was strongly dependent on their level of delusion and artistic ability . The more practical you were , the less power you had in this New World . Naturally , anyone who 's won the lottery , received an inheritance , or suddenly found themselves attractive can tell you what this 'll do to a person . <newline> <newline> War broke out . First it was between the Realists and the Dreamers , as they called themselves . The Realists quickly lost ground , and now live on reservations . Then there were fights between the Dreamers , divided by canon . OCs became mercenaries , their 'delusion field ' only extending to a small radius around their person . Those who subscribed to particular canons could form gestalts , and entire cities could congregate together to essentially change the laws , within a six mile radius , to suit the consensus . <newline> <newline> But though laws of physics can be changed , there is still a meta to metaphysics . The newest academic field is Fandom Physics , which analyses the large-scale phenomena that result when different canons collide . What happens if two cities have six-mile Delusion Fields , but are only three miles apart ? Will they cleanly integrate like most Modern stories do ? Or collide violently when you cross Final Fantasy and Dead or Alive ( Monty Oum has been elevated to patron deity of that region ) . <newline> <newline> And magic !

Prepare for descent. ” the pilot stated too matter in factly . <newline> <newline> “ All men . Up ! ” Decanus Severus barked . <newline> <newline> Over the undulating whirs of the odonata 's wings , Decanus Severus stood up in front of the contubernium . With a solemn glance , my eyes met the rest of the men as I rose- these proud men from all stretches of the Empire , most to seek citizenship for their families no doubt . As I stood , my body jerked from the initial resistance of my lorica . It adjusted itself and streamed down a list of armor checks . <newline> <newline> “ Callum Malleo VII ... online ... OK ” my suit said aloud- with the same words echoing for each man . <newline> <newline> “ Drop point in two , ” the pilot stated . <newline> <newline> At that cue , Decanus Severus pulled open the 300 lb steel door with ease . Wind swept in and had our suits not been as heavy as they were , we would have all been thrown back . Right next to us , in formation , were the rest of the century . Decanus Severus nodded at the others . <newline> <newline> “ Drop ! ” <newline> <newline> Red lights lit up around us as screens displayed the word , In Nomine Imperator ! <newline> <newline> “ From the skies brothers ! ” <newline> <newline> My suit 's legs roared into action as we , one by one , jumped out of the odonata into the great sky beyond . At hundreds of pes in the sky , we could see the battle ensuing in Nova Romana . While the Vigiles Urbani held up positions using wreckage from fallen buildings- our drop point was far from them . <newline> <newline> “ Once we hit , group up . We 're the strike force. ” <newline> <newline> A hundred men were all falling from the sky- while we were donned in our Callum Malleo VIIs in a rapid-response configuration , a couple of the other contuberniums each held Scutum Indominae . They were responsible for holding the entirety of the front . My suit displayed an ETA on the lower right HUD . It counted five seconds before we landed . <newline> <newline> “ For the Emperor ! ” <newline> <newline> For the unlucky few who stood below us , their bodies were vaporized .

You wake up drenched in sweat , with crystal clear knowledge of the totality of your failure . To some men , the heights they could have soared made recognizing this day nearly impossible . For many , the dream came with the depressing realization of how little they could have amounted to . But for those in the middle , those who cold yet conceive of a perfectly actualized life , the allure of this alternate reality consumed even the knowledge of their imminent demise . This combination of hope and myopia was the lifeblood of payday lenders for generations , it took them an embarrassingly long amount of time to tap this market . <newline> <newline> The applications were the prospectuses of lunatics , incapable of separating their life of booze sodden compromise from the cloistered life of work and neglect which lead to their best selves And at the bottom of each is the untidy scrawled signature of the approving manager .

Ghon laughed 'I 'd like to see you try , Jerry ' . The nickname Ghon called him always got Jerris ' nerves , but Jerris refrained , 'I actually can not even be bothered , youre not even worth it ' . True . I thought to myself , Ghon was practically immortal , simply because he could regenerate from any wound , a handy trait to possess in our line of work . But the side effect was that to keep up this unbreakable defence , he was always hungry , and had to consume copious amounts of food , often at the expense of the Ministry that funded us . <newline> <newline> The conversation between my companions had always been savage and violent , to the extent they would often fight until they were exhausted , with no amount of intervention able to stop them once they began , you really did just have to let it take its course once that occurred .

The powers that have never reappeared are what we call god-tier , as they are often incredibly powerful or useful . There have been only 7 recorded , with only 1 currently still being active . It belonged to the man who was the head of the Ministry , a man called Reqrestrius John , an imposing man standing 7f 5 , and with the incredible power to cancel , as in cancel anything he wanted , all he had to do was touch it , and it would vanish . with this power , he had ended all adversaries in their stance , and had brought peace to our world .

It started at the absolute lowest point of my life . Actually , I think the day before the lowest , because the lowest was the next morning . On the day I tried to die , I was really depressed . Clinically depressed , it 's called . Every thought I had revolved around what a terrible person I was , how I deserved to die , how I wanted it to just end . I would think briefly how much happier people would be when I was gone , but I realise now that I actually barely thought about other people at all . I was basically mad with pain and not thinking straight , even if the pain was emotional rather than physical . <newline> <newline> So I jumped in front of a train . It was n't even a decision , not really . I was trying to get to my doctor and I suddenly could n't face the idea of telling someone who had been so blank the last time , what was going through my head now . It was my only way out , but it just seemed impossibly hard , and there was n't any future that was worth having . And then the tube was on its way in and I was jumping before I 'd even decided what to do next . <newline> <newline> It was like being smacked really hard into a giant speaker . It did n't hurt , not at first . Just this THUMP . And then I landed , and I thought this is it , I 'll land on the rails or get sliced up . But I sort of rolled under the train for quite a long time . I could smell oil and metal more than anything . I do n't remember seeing the driver . I 'm really , really sorry about the driver . I just was n't thinking at all , not about anything . I did n't know I was going to jump . I definitely did n't go there to jump . <newline> <newline> And then I lay there for a really long time , and the physical pain started , and you know what ? I felt a lot better . I really hurt , physically , all over . It made the endless thoughts finally shut up for a while . I was thinking this is it , I am dying . I could n't smell any blood , or really feel anything either , other than that I was hurt . I was just lying there while people moved around , cleared the platform , rolled the train forward . <newline> <newline> The other passengers were really angry and upset . I could n't make out words , but they did n't sound happy . I should have gone for paracetamol , except I did n't actually plan to kill myself at all . It just sort of happened . Anyway , the lights came back on and I had police looking down at me . I was blinking in the lights and one of the men swore and then went and threw up . It really stank . Another man kneeled down and asked if I could hear him , and I said yes , and a woman was talking into her radio , but I could n't make it out . The police man told me not to move . And eventually paramedics came and put me in an ambulance . They made me not look at anything . All I could see was yellow blocks either side of my head , and this woman 's face , a paramedic , telling me I was going to be okay . I met her again later on and I did n't recognise her until she said hello , and then I burst out crying . It was really embarrassing , for all different reasons . <newline> <newline> Anyway , the rest is all in the news , if you want to look . I made a miracle recovery , and now you ca n't tell anything had ever happened . I did get to see a psychiatrist without a referral . Most people were really good about it . I just felt so awful about what I 'd done to everyone and how much time I 'd wasted . I got lots of post , but nobody would let me read most of it . I got a lot of hate mail and threats , and my parents got it too . Dad was shouting at me how I was ruining things for him and mum , how they were going to have to move and it was all my fault , and then some nurses came in and he left and I did n't see him again , or mum , or anyone really . Mum sent me a card , but I did n't reply and she did n't send another . <newline> <newline> Anyway , I was back on my feet with all my arms and legs and everything back after twenty four hours , and I thought fuck . I 'm back exactly where I was before . I got really high off the morphine until they realised what was going on and I could n't have any more , and I missed it . I missed not feeling anything and not giving a damn . And I spent a while in a loony bin , which was n't as bad as I thought it would be , even with all the nutters . It was mostly really boring . I talked about what had happened and after a couple of weeks I was let out to go into therapy , CBT . I ca n't remember what it stands for , but you think different about things and it helps put life in a different aspect , and it 's really good if you can keep going to it . But I think people need more help right at the start , because once a week is n't enough , not when you 're really bad . <newline> <newline> So anyway , yeah , I think it was about a week after that when I went around and got loads of paracetamol and tried again . I spent the whole day going around London , just getting pills at different supermarkets and shops . I thought somehow the pharmacies would pick up what I was doing but I did n't think supermarkets would care . Going around buying stuff to kill myself , it was the happiest I 'd ever been . It 's sad , really . Honestly , I was actually smiling and everything . At first I was worried a reporter would find the Miracle Girl but I was only in a couple of tabloids and I looked really different , with my hair cut short right after I got out of the hospital . <newline> <newline> So yeah , that was a really rotten week . Do n't commit suicide with paracetemol . It feels really , really bad . Like , worse than getting hit by a train , and I would know . I did n't tell anyone , and I feel really crappy that nobody checked up on me , even at therapy when I missed going . I just sort of slipped through the net . I definitely took enough pills to die . It was more than a thousand . <newline> <newline> Anyway , that was when I realised I could n't die . I could be hurt , but I always got better really quickly . Slower for poison , quicker if I really fucked myself up . It got a bit mad after that , after more people realised what was going on and I hit the national press . I did n't have any money , and I did n't know what to do with all the post . I could n't get any emails or go on Twitter . <newline> <newline> People offered me loads of money for my story . There was this one reporter , he was from this terrible newspaper , and I thought it would be awful talking to him , but I thought back then I deserved to feel awful all the time . But he was really nice , and I just opened up about everything that was going on . Just talking about it , what was going on and why I kept trying to kill myself , it helped . Like , I realised it just was n't ever going to change . I realised that the only time I was actually properly happy was when I was getting things together for another attempt , because that was the only time I was really looking out for myself . It 's screwed up , but I felt terrible and I was just trying to feel better . <newline> <newline> Anyway , this reporter said there 's all this evidence that you just ca n't die , so why not do some stunts ? I think he said have you thought about going into stunts or extreme sports . But you need to be really fit for those , and if I was motivated to get fit , well , I would n't be depressed , would I . But I did get a camera and start putting the videos on YouTube . I got in so much trouble for that . Liveleak was showing them , but I was n't getting a penny , then someone offered to set up a domain , and the advertising , and I could afford a lawyer just with interviews . I did twenty videos before I gave up . I got some really weird fans . <newline> <newline> So it was after all that , that 's when that reporter got back to me . He 'd been doing this bit about how people doing hazardous clean up on things like nuclear accidents and chemical accidents die really early , and he thought of me , but we could n't work out how to sort out training . But that was the first time I actually had something I wanted to really do , and it turns out it makes all the difference . <newline> <newline> I really got into the CBT , and tried different pills which were horrible , but I was warned they could be . I just kept trying new ones until I found one that worked and did n't make me fat or a zombie . Six months after getting onto sertraline I was getting my life back together . I stopped doing the videos , and people forgot really quickly that I even existed . I tried with the fire department and the army . That reporter was amazing , he knew all these people . He wanted to make a long feature out of it , but I think if he had n't cared at least a little he would n't have worked so hard to get me on the right path . <newline> <newline> And now I 've got a life . It pays fuck all , honestly , especially considering I 've already died three times , but I 've got a job , got a degree even , and I love what I do . Obviously I ca n't talk about it in any detail , but yeah , the Navy really came through for me . <newline> <newline> I think killing myself was the best thing I ever did .

[/INST] `` Here 's you lunch , Commander ! '' <newline> <newline> Said the security guard , tossing a tray full of grey paste into the nearby cell . The prisoner that resided lay upright on his bed , staring at the ceiling . Yet another Super Villain caught by a Super Hero . <newline> <newline> `` You 'll be wanting some sauce with that , am I right ! ? '' <newline> <newline> Yelled the guard as he waddled away down the corridor , laughing boisterously as he turned to meet his colleagues in the office/poker room . <newline> <newline> `` When I get outta here fatty , you 'll be eating those words '' <newline> Whispered Commander , sighing as he watched the grey gunk pulsate on the plastic tray . `` Food like that should never move '' he thought , `` and it especially should n't be doing that '' . He threw a nearby book at the tray hoping the food would scurry away to disgust some other poor soul , because he sure as hell was n't going to eat it . <newline> Suddenly the cell began to vibrate . The tray on the floor , the bed , the shelves , everything began to move and shake . The Commander covered his eyes as sparks began to flash in the middle of the cell , and a blinding light followed from an opening in thin air . The light grew brighter as the opening grew wider and a loud creaking noise followed , echoing down the corridor . The light subsided and a tall figure caped and clad in majestic armor , stepped out of the opening . A wave of his hand caused the creaking to start again , before thuddng as the opening closed itself . The figure stood up straight and his eyes glowed a bright blue through his helmet visor . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings fellow Villain ! '' Bellowed the strange figure , `` fear not , for I am your salvation ! '' <newline> <newline> The Commander stared in awe at this strange being who materialised before him , hundreds of questions flooding his mind , but no words could escape his mouth . <newline> <newline> `` I see you are in need of answers '' said the knight `` well I shall give you 3 questions so be quick about it , I have n't got all day '' <newline> <newline> The Commander snapped out of his trance began to stutter . <newline> <newline> `` Er -- erm well . I-I-I guess my first question is how the hell did you get in here ! ? '' Asked the Commander , now rising from his bed . <newline> `` Oh , I was n't expecting that question first , but very well ! '' Said the knight , holding out his armored hand to demonstrate . `` That was what I like to call my Doorway . I can create small doorways from one place to another '' he said , creating a small portal in the space above his palm , complete with creak and light , like a door opening into nothingness . `` I simply opened a door from my lair to here , and we 'll here I am . Please do not ask me how it 's done . I have neither the time nor the patience to explain the power to every villain I free '' <newline> <newline> `` Free ! ? '' Quizzed the Commander , his eyes widening in excitement <newline> <newline> `` Okay ! Second question ! That 's right , I 'm here to free you , you poor sad man ! '' The figure laughed , brushing aside his tattered cape and revealing a large leather-bound book . The book appeared to be old but upon close inspection , it was just made to look old . He opened the book and cleared his throat . `` Now then , you are The Con -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait wait wait , who the hell are you ? '' Interrupted the Commander <newline> <newline> `` Oh , okay then , third question it is . '' He answered closing the book again . I , dear boy , am the Keymaster ! Master of Locks ! Conjurer of Doors ! And the KEY to the victory of the Villains in this city ! '' He opened the book once more , this time equipping a pair of reading glasses in front of his visor , and reading from it nonchalantly . `` Ahem ! Now then , you are The Condiment Commander , correct ? You were attempting to rob a safety deposit bank on the 18th of July , exclaiming that the law would never , and I quote , Ketchup with you , when you were foiled by leader of the Solar Squadron : Final Flare . That right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... ... yes '' admitted The Condiment Commander , begrudgingly . <newline> <newline> `` Right then ! '' Said the Keymaster , slamming the book shut and taking his glasses off , `` well despite your below-average evil-doing success rate , and your ranking in the Villain 's guild database , I have a feeling that the villains of this city will still need your unique ... ... ... skills ? During the final face off with the heroes that plague this wretched place . Do n't you want to even the score with that Final Flare . This is your chance , boy !

I still have to rescue that bone-head Bullserker , and that god-awful woman Typhoonia or whatever she 's calling herself now '' <newline> <newline> As they both stepped into the Portal , the final loud creak echoed once again through the halls , overlapping the footsteps of the guards running to the disturbance , and a flash of light covered the cell .

Science gives me less and less places to hide , and so do the faithful , and they 're both wrong .

I hesitated to break the silence , yet as I tried to remain patient I wondered awkwardly how long it might take until a god broke their own silence . It could be forever . On the other hand , I did n't appear to have anything else to do , or anywhere else to go . Truly , this is what being dead felt like . <newline> <newline> `` So , what 's your best guess then ?

Interesting , '' I drew myself up , to convince myself more than He . `` So , if , if everyone has always been wrong about you , that would mean that you 're neither all-powerful nor not-all-powerful , and the same with your omniscience .

Despite how real the pillow beneath my head felt , I was adamant that this was all a dream . <newline> <newline> `` Just got to wake up . '' I said to myself , hands over my eyes `` That 's all . Just got to wake up . '' <newline> <newline> Someone knocked at my front door . <newline> <newline> `` Just got to wake up . '' <newline> <newline> They knocked again . <newline> <newline> I wiped the tears away and went to the door . As my hand gripped the handle I paused . `` Who is it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's Carol , saw your car out front . '' Said a voice like Carol 's `` Figured we could grab a coffee and watch some 'toons if you 're not going to work . '' <newline> <newline> Carol is my neighbour from a few houses down . A friend . She is a young women that enjoys tattoos , skate-boarding , and cartoons - hobbies of which I could only relate to one . <newline> <newline> I opened the door and sighed with relief . I then sucked the sigh back in with a quiet gasp as she walked into my house . <newline> <newline> She had looked normal , and was - mostly . <newline> <newline> A faint and not unpleasant green coloured her skin and darkened in a few areas : her cheeks , her eyelids ... <newline> <newline> Where tattoos had travelled up her arms there was vines , not made of ink , but real vines . A wreath of flowers adorned her head . She still wore a stretched and tattered T-shirt with the faded logo of some band , grubby blue jeans , and flat bottomed sneakers . <newline> <newline> I do n't know why I could tell her and not the Doc , but I did . <newline> <newline> * * * <newline> <newline> `` That 's fucked up , Pauly . '' She said when I had finished describing what I had seen on the TV and at Malachi Bint 's medical practice . `` Wait ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I 'm crazy , right ? No one looks like themselves ! '' I said . I watched her face . Waited for her to scream or back away from the madman and find an excuse to leave . She just seemed confused . <newline> <newline> `` Wait ... '' <newline> <newline> `` You can leave if you want . '' I said `` I think I 'll just check myself into a mental hosp- '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait , wait , wait ! '' She had a smile on her face `` What am I ? Have I got bat wings ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Um , no . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` Do I at least have a tail ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No . No tail '' She was going to hate what I saw . She would want to be something cool and instead she was some plant lady . <newline> <newline> `` Anything cool ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , um . '' <newline> <newline> She squinted , leaned forward and put a hand on my knee `` Paul , describe me . '' <newline> <newline> I did . <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> I described her again . <newline> <newline> `` That 's what I thought you said . '' She looked at me with a raised eyebrow . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't get to choose how I see people , sorry . '' <newline> <newline> `` Paul . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ? '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's exactly how I look . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at her - green and beautiful and ... and ... <newline> <newline> `` Fuckin what ? '' I said as what she said hit me . <newline> <newline> * * * <newline> <newline> I dragged Carol with me into Dr Bint 's office as a bright winged fairy left . <newline> <newline> `` Paul , I- '' He started . <newline> <newline> I closed the door behind Carol and I , and said `` Doc , I need your help . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you need , Paul . '' His voice was calm and caring and his eyes were on Carol `` And you are ? '' <newline> <newline> She put out a hand `` Carol , Carol Channing . '' <newline> <newline> The Satyr Dr Bint smiled and gave her offered hand a shake `` Any- '' <newline> <newline> `` No , no relation '' Said Carol with a forced smile . <newline> <newline> I was giddy and smiling . It could n't be , could it ? `` Doc , describe her for me . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' He said . <newline> <newline> `` Just do it , please . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , um , she is a young women in her twenties who likes a band called , err , *Eedle Moth* ? '' <newline> <newline> She chuckled `` Needle Mouth , the shirts pretty faded . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , I see ! '' <newline> <newline> `` No , Doc , physically , describe her physically ! '' As I said this they both looked at me . <newline> <newline> He fiddled with his glasses and went red . `` I do n't think that that is appropriate , I hardly- '' <newline> <newline> `` Just complection and the like , Doc . '' <newline> <newline> They looked at eachother and Carol shrugged . <newline> <newline> `` Well , she has healthy green skin ... '' <newline> <newline> I fought back a cheer as the Doctor said it . *I 'm not crazy ! * <newline> <newline> `` ... she has a lot of vine work on her arms , very good work by the way , talented artist . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I 've got a good guy . I 'm gon na get him to do flowers on my back . '' <newline> <newline> `` I always wanted a tattoo , '' The Doctor said with a chuckle `` Could never settle on a design , though . '' <newline> <newline> `` Carol , describe the Doc . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well I do n't think- '' The Doctor started , but Carol dove straight in . <newline> <newline> `` He 's got a kind , sweet look to him ; strong hairy legs , I 'd say his a runner ; he 's got a full head of hair , wo n't be going bald any time soon ; and has a ... *unique* choice of neck tie . '' She looked at me and smiled `` Do I pass ? '' <newline> <newline> I was lost in thought . Had been since she confirmed the Doc had goat legs . *What in the hell is going on ? * <newline> <newline> `` Wait . '' I said aloud `` What do I look like ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You 've got healthy beige skin and hair in only a few places , why ? '' Said Dr Bint . <newline> <newline> *So , I still look how I thought I looked ... * <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I explained to the Doc what had brought me to him in the first place and then what had brought me back . He offered to check me in to the hospital , to have some scans , and I took it . <newline> <newline> They found nothing . I was healthy and , psychologically , was not a threat to anyone . <newline> <newline> After a few days I went home . <newline> <newline> I now spend my mornings before work trying to find others like me . Others that remember the way the world was . I 'm convinced that it has changed - or that I 've somehow travelled to an alternate reality . <newline> <newline> There 's got to be someone else . <newline> <newline> At least it gives me something to do in the mornings . <newline> <newline> Carol and I watch cartoons at night . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> *Edit : Came back to find that I had some gold .

He become a grey Jedi . [/INST] Something kept poking at Palpatine 's mind ; something was calling to him . It had kept him up for days at a time , and was slowly starting to interfere with his grand plans concerning Order 66 . Something had altered the balance of the Force , something that ascended the matters of Sith and Jedi . <newline> <newline> `` Master , the Kaminoans have told us that the inhibitor chips in the Clones are ready to be activated at will . '' said the voice of apprentice Darth Vader . `` Master ? Something disturbs you , what is it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A disturbance in the Force , Anakin . Someone has achieved a promising sign of power . A rival to your power . '' responded Palpatine , who was now formulating a plan to test his dark apprentice even further . <newline> <newline> `` Who is it my Lord ? Master Yoda ? Obi-Wan ? '' the voice of Anakin was filling with hate and anger , he could not comprehend that someone was able to compete with his level of power . Nor did he want to accept it . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , let the hate flow through you , Anakin . '' said Palpatine as he cynically started cackling . `` A Jedi Knight who has left the order ; he has achieved a balance of both light and dark within himself . Such power , such control has never been seen before . It must be stopped . '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course my Lord , I shall leave immediately . Where is this Jedi ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , Lord Vader . You shall not leave today . '' said Palpatine , purposefully adding a pause to rile up the negative feelings in his apprentice . `` The 501st is slated to storm the Jedi Temple , they will dispose of this self proclaimed Grey Jedi . '' <newline> <newline> `` My Lord , this is outrageous . The clones are tasked with something that you even admit is a rival to **my power** ? I could destroy the entire temple by myself ! You can not hold me back ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Excellent , Anakin , excellent ! The hate flows through you , I feel it . You are ready ; join the 501st tomorrow and kill this grey Jedi , kill all the Jedi you encounter on your way to him as well .

Lord Vader let his hatred flow through his body and grow with each kill he gained ; he was determined to silence any and all competition to his spot as apprentice to Palpatine . <newline> <newline> `` Break formation and catch any stragglers . Go . '' the command was simple , yet Vader still thought he placed too much trust in the clones for such a big task . `` I will find you Grey Jedi , show yourself . '' shouting , and sprinting around the temple , Vader continued to slay Jedi until he could focus on his target . <newline> <newline> `` Lord Vader , or should I say Anakin Skywalker , traitor to the galaxy ? '' said a voice from behind the Jedi Library . `` I am the Grey Jedi you search for . I am Master Ram Dar . '' <newline> <newline> Vader was not expecting a young man , no older than twenty , brandishing a newly forged yellow Lightsaber in a defensive position . `` You die today , Ram Dar . The Sith show no mercy to any type of Jedi . '' <newline> <newline> `` So be it . Your angry flows through you , as does mine , but you can not control it ; you have let your anger blind you , I have let mine guide me . <newline> <newline> Vader had enough of the philosphical talk and force sprinted towards Ram Dar at an incredible speed pounding his lightsaber across his multiple times : to Vader 's surprise , Ram Dar was able to keep up to pace with the strikes . Pouncing overhead with a force charged front flip , Ram Dar used the force to push Vader on the ground . Vader leapt back up and continued with the offensive blows while Ram Dar used a defensive style . Vader grew quickly tired of this and started pouring his anger into his blows , his eyes turning into a familiar orange , a sign of a Sith . Ram Dar noting the charge of negative energy switched to an offensive fighting style to combat the power shift , but Ram Dar 's offensive blows could not match those of Vader . <newline> <newline> `` You tap into the Dark Side for power , very clever . Yet you use the Light Side to remain in your oh so elegant form . How proper of you . '' mocked Vader `` But let 's end this- '' interrupted by a force choke being performed by Ram Dar , Vader found himself being choked significantly , the air escaping his lungs and his breath rapidly fainting . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Vader , let us end this . '' said Ram Dar as he tightened his grip , now walking himself and Vader to a nearby wall to finish the act . As Vader was pressed against the wall an explosion could be heard in the distance , knowing this was the clones all Vader had to do was break free of this grip and stall him long enough for a much , much closer explosion . Closing his eyes Vader thought of his true love , Padme , and focused the force flowing through his body to push Ram Dar off of him , screaming with his might as he breathed again . Pulling Ram Dar with the force towards the same wall , Vader told the clones to fire an explosive weapon towards the wall . For once , Vader put genuine trust in the clones and he was satisfied when the explosion crippled Ram Dar to his knees . <newline> <newline> `` I will admit you were a challenge , but you were never a real threat to me . '' said Vader as he beheaded the Grey Jedi . Tired and weakened from a fight that should 've ended faster , Vader prepared to travel to Mustafar to meet his Master in person . <newline> </s>\n","<s>[INST] You receive a job offer online .

[/INST] The sound of the sea wakes me from my sleep . <newline> <newline> I open my eyes and am greeted by darkness . Bewildered , I grope around in a panic until I realise I ’ ve been dreaming . It ’ s the same dream every time- I ’ m walking on a sandy beach . The sun is beating down on me , and I ’ m pleasantly hot . I can taste the salt of the ocean air , feel the soft sand beneath my feet and hear the roar of the waves . I am surrounded by golden sand and endless stretches of sea . I look down and see my shadow next to me . I look down to discern its shape , and then I wake up . The few seconds between dreaming and being awake are bliss . Then the hard reality comes crashing down on me . <newline> <newline> I look out the window . There ’ s a moon tonight . The neighbourhood is lit up in a soft glow . It ’ s risky , but I have to take what I ’ ve got . Hurriedly , I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness . The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver . I walk briskly . At night , everything is silent . It ’ s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake . All the houses look large and imposing . The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them . I start to jog to warm up , and soon I ’ m sweating . I think back to my dream . Every time , I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be . If only I could stay a few seconds longer , I would find out . And then… <newline> <newline> I ’ m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road . We both see each other at the same time , and eye each other warily .

He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight . The universal sign of peace . I see his shadow come into view . It ’ s a dog . I ’ m guessing a golden retriever . Under the lamplight , both the boy and the dog stare at me , alert . If I was a normal person , a ‘ good guy ’ , I ’ d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too . But I don ’ t . I turn around and walk in the other direction , and hear him break into a run . He ’ s afraid of me . The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they ’ re ‘ bad ' .

[/INST] ( excerpt from Sid Meier 's `` Civilization '' , Volume 5 - 1850 to 2100 ) <newline> <newline> It was the period that the pitiful civilization of the French referred to as `` fin de siècle '' . Tensions remained high following the Zulu defeat of Pharaoh Ramesses , as India meanwhile swept up the last of the Babylonian resistance , but change was coming . <newline> <newline> In 1915 , Abraham Lincoln unexpectedly converted to Democracy . This sudden and drastic conversion shocked the world . Throughout the American Empire , from its seat of power in Washington DC , east to London on the British Isles , south to Detroit on the southernmost tip of South America , and west to the plains of Siberia , citizens were tired of endless war . <newline> <newline> Perhaps no one benefited more from this change in government than the Romans . In the stronghold of Caesarea , where a single militia unit had desperately held off the American siege for almost a decade , there was celebration in the streets . <newline> <newline> By 1945 , the so-called Pax Americana had spread around the world . In this year , the Chinese navy retired the last of its ancient triremes , while settlers completed civic improvements to railroad and irrigation around the cities of Paoting , Yangchow , and New City 1 . Meanwhile , Shanghai began construction of the United Nations . <newline> <newline> In 1965 , the Russians completed the Apollo Program , and within a decade had launched five structural components for an interstellar spacecraft . This triggered a space race , as the Russians , Americans , and Zulus scrambled to become the first civilization to reach Alpha Centauri . <newline> <newline> By the latter half of the 20th century , peace was the rule around the globe . Treaties existed between all major powers . Democracy was on the rise . Lincoln , Stalin , and Shaka were engaged in a friendly ( but heated ) rivalry to launch humans to another solar system , with the enthusiastic support of UN Commissioner Pravin Lal . It appeared that these civilizations had , at long last , built a peace that would stand the test of time . <newline> <newline> Everything changed , however , when Gandhi got the Bomb . </s>\n","<s>[INST] It is believed that the cure for cancer has been discovered on Mars , astronauts have only one chance to bring it home where they hope to duplicate its properties for mass distribution [/INST] `` Dr. Edmunds , something interesting came up on the latest screen , '' stated Johannes , the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism . <newline> <newline> `` This better be good . My grant proposal is due Friday , '' stated Edmunds , finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes . He quickly glanced at the ground , concealing his surprise . Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual . His face started to burn . Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund 's office without scheduling an appointment . Luckily , Johannes ' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention . She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray , hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled . He must have been working double shifts . <newline> <newline> `` I-If this is what I think it is , you 'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money , '' Johannes replied . `` I repeated this experiment three times , always in triplicates . Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001 . In other words , there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation , and -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me see , '' she interrupted . Johannes passed her the sheets of data . Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward , brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers . <newline> <newline> Sample 1215 : at long last , a positive hit . <newline> <newline> A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund 's face , then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin . Eyes shining , she said , `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony , hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth ... . '' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth . Pulling away , spots of blood were seen . She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief . There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric . The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . <newline> <newline> Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued . `` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' <newline> <newline> Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro* , it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells . In the animal model , this compound appears to stop angiogenesis . In other words , in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity , it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds slowly stood , smile unwavering . `` You have made a remarkable discovery , Johannes . You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D. , with nothing less than the highest honors . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , Dr. Edmunds . Without your direction , this would n't have been possible , '' Johannes replied , bowing his head . A shadow crept over his face . There was a hesitating silence before he continued . `` I ... I knew about your condition all along . The cancer you tried to keep secret . The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth . The way you are now ... .There is n't much time . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement . It was foolish of her to think the others would n't have noticed by now . <newline> <newline> `` I can give you the first treatment , '' Johannes said , looking up to meet Edmunds ' eyes . `` It might give you more time . Enough to see that we take it home over the years . '' <newline> <newline> Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window , beyond the red terrain and into the sky . `` Yes , I would like that very much . But that ca n't be the focus now . I did n't tell anyone this , but there 's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home . Back on Earth , people have given up so much hope that they do n't want to allocate anymore resources to us . The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' Johannes blurted loudly . `` There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month ? For all of the people affected on Earth ? How can we manage that ? '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds sighed . The weariness she felt was not only physical . `` What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215 , and find out the conditions it best grows in . Then , we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth . If we can grow the bacteria on Earth , we can produce the cure there . I want this done in six months . That is when you all will be scheduled to leave . '' <newline> <newline> `` Just wait a second -- what do you mean , 'you all ' ? Are n't you going also ? '' Johannes said . He pulled a chair from the desk . His head was spinning . <newline> <newline> Edmunds smiled sadly . `` When I came here , I never expected I would actually return . There 's nothing left for me on Earth . '' Her gaze drifted to a framed picture on her desk , of a smiling family . Edmunds was once a young wife , with a husband and three children . `` I 'll carry on work here for as long as I can , and relay information to you from here . It was my hope that *you* would personally take over my work . You were always my favorite student ... .It is your choice , of course ... .But should this grant get approved , your scientific career will be set .

The inside was grimy and the walls where filled with various mementoes from around the world , brought by traders who found themselves unable to pay for their drinks as they had yet to turn a profit in the London market ; Stags heads , exotic stuffed creatures and various antiques adorned the walls on uneven shelves , alongside artificial alchemist ’ s fire , left smouldering at night to guide any lingering drunks to their beds .

Bastard. ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re a monster. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , ” he smiled a huge smile and held his hands out in an over-the-top display of sarcasm . “ I thought I said that already. ” <newline> <newline> “ But you ’ re a human. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , I ’ m a monster . I can just look like a human. ” <newline> <newline> “ And you go to university. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , ‘ cause you can ’ t do anything these days without a degree. ” <newline> <newline> “ But you ’ re a monster. ” <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ve established that ... ” the guy beside me was clearly getting frustrated . <newline> <newline> “ But— ” <newline> <newline> Behind me , there was a furious pounding on the wall . “ GO TO BED , FAGGOT ! IT ’ S FOUR-THIRTY ! FUCK ! ” <newline> <newline> The guy beside me jumped up , and looked behind us . “ What the ... ” <newline> <newline> “ I ... ” I sighed , and lowered my voice . “ Well , there ’ s a reason I was awake at four AM on a Wednesday morning when I have class in ... three hours ? ” I smiled wanely . <newline> <newline> “ Okay ? ” the monster-man looked at me and then back at the wall . “ Because if he— ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m 18-years-old , graduated early , from the interior , so everybody I know is back in school three , four hours away here , if the roads are good . My family doesn ’ t have a lot of money , so we found one the cheapest rents close to school , and there ’ s a good reason . Because the Kim ’ s newphew is renting the other . And he ’ s a pro-gamer wanna-be who stays up ‘ till early morning blasting his games and playing his dance music , he has parties every weekend , he has probably never touched a cloth in his life , and flies are everywhere and he acts like he owns the place ‘ cause he ’ s their nephew and aaaaaaaaaaaaugh ... ” I fell back onto my bed . <newline> <newline> “ You feeling okay there , guy ? ” the monster actually sounded concerned for me . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m not getting sleep , I ’ m failing my classes , and I ’ m afraid I ’ m gon na let my parents down . And there ’ s now a monster in my closet. ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t ... ” he caught himself before going any further . “ Listen , okay . I know things are tough . But right now , you and I are going to have to work together . Because right now , you ’ re my responsibility . You ’ re awakened now , and you ’ re start seeing all sorts of weirdness . And because I screwed up and ended up waking you up , I— ” <newline> <newline> “ I haven ’ t been able to sleep in weeks ... ” I grumbled . <newline> <newline> “ Metaphorically ! ” he snapped back at me . “ You couldn ’ t see magic now you can , you were asleep now you ’ re awake , you pierced the Veil . Whatever you want to say. ” <newline> <newline> “ So what , you ’ re supposed to be my teacher ? ” <newline> <newline> The monster-guy made a thoroughly unhappy sound and sat down next to me . “ Yes ? Kinda . I have no idea . I just know if you cause trouble , my ass is grass. ” <newline> <newline> “ So now we ’ re both screwed ... ” I looked over at him . <newline> <newline> “ Pretty much , ” he sighed . <newline> <newline> “ I SAID CUT IT FAGGOT ! ” there was more pounding on the wall . <newline> <newline> “ Oh God ... ” I closed my eyes , and groaned . Then , in my overtired state , a stupid idea came to mind . I looked up at the monster . “ You mentioned you had a room , right ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , I have a small loft way down in Surrey . I wanted something bigger or closer , but the Parliament— ” <newline> <newline> “ So , you , as a human , have a place ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah ... ” <newline> <newline> “ And you as a monster , you scare people. ” <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s what we do. ” <newline> <newline> “ How would you like a bigger apartment ? ” I grinned . “ One where you can easily watch me ? Plus it ’ s closer to the university. ” <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , you scare my roommate , he becomes convinced that this haunted , I dunno , he moves out , and ... '' <newline> <newline> The monster stared at me for a few seconds , speechless . <newline> <newline> “ Hey , '' I shrugged . `` You solve my problems , and I can try to solve yours , I guess . Win win ? ” <newline> <newline> “ By the bogeyman ... ” the monster muttered , and held forth his hand . “ I guess it ’ s a deal. ” <newline> <newline> I grabbed it and shook his hand . “ Thanks ... I don ’ t know your name . I can ’ t just keep calling you ‘ monster , ’ can I ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You can , but you ’ ve got a point . It ’ s Kevin Wong when I look like this. ” <newline> <newline> “ And when you look like the raptor ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , ” he smiled , and I swore I saw fangs . “ Call me Claw . By the way , you wouldn ’ t happen to know what your soon-to-be former roommate is afraid of ? ” <newline> <newline> I smiled back . This was going to be the start of a productive friendship . </s>\n","<s>[INST] Your friends dare you to stay one night in the abandoned hospital . You do it . [/INST] `` Come on , Ian , just do it . What , are you scared ? '' I turned and glared at Steven , who 'd been taunting me all night . Really , all of my friends had been taunting me . Steven had his arm around a young girl , Cindy , with a swirl of blonde hair pinned loose in a bun and a flowing sundress covered in scattered , white polka-dots . Leaning against a stop sign was a taller boy , beat up hoodie and jeans with dark , brown hair and even darker brown eyes . He watched us with amusement , waiting for my answer as I stalled , pretending to look for something in my car . I felt a tug on the back of my coat and turned to see two beautiful brown eyes peering up at me . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't be a chicken , Ian , '' those eyes make my stomach flutter and her voice clears my head of any intelligent thoughts . I shut the door behind me and take in the girl before me , Lucy , honey-colored hair draped around her shoulders , and a loose-fitting sweater over tight jeans . We 'd been playing some kind of cat-and-muse game for a few weeks now and of course , Steven invited her along to try and bend me to his will in some way . Only now did I see in what way . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm really not sure I want to spend the night in the old abandoned hospital , '' I mutter , tearing my gaze from hers to look up the hill at the decrepit building . The guy at the stop sign , Jake , shifted his weight and walked over to the rest of the group , patting my shoulder . <newline> <newline> `` It 'll be fine , Ian . The place is huge and we can just explore it all night . '' I brushed his hand away and avoided Lucy 's eyes , turning back to glare at Steven . <newline> <newline> `` What 's in it for me , man ? This is such bullshit . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I do n't know , man , '' Steven answered , nodding toward Lucy . She glanced back at him and he looked up into the sky , feigning innocence and even whistling for effect . Lucy shook her head with a smirk and her eyes locked with mine and I knew my answer as much as I hated to admit it . As we began to trudge up the hill , we were joined by Jake 's younger sister , Emily . She looked excited to be included and while Jake greeted her and Cindy and Lucy stopped to chat together , Steven jogged over to my side , staring at the twisted , iron gate . `` This 'll be great , dude . You can score a little action with Lucy , man . It 's perfect ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I would n't call an old , empty hospital *perfect , * Steve , '' I sighed and watched her for a second before turning to study the hospital again . `` I always figured we 'd go on a date before we started breaking into buildings to do it ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Think of this as a date , Ian . I 'm sure there 'll be beds in here somewhere . Do n't be such a bitch , dude . Strap up , strap on , and let 's party . '' He laughed as Cindy approached him and wrapped an arm around her , pushing the gates open as I heard her asking what we 'd been talking about . <newline> <newline> `` Strap on ? What the ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Strap on , huh ? '' I jumped as Lucy 's voice sounded behind me . `` What 's that mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh , nothing ! Something Steve said . '' I rubbed my neck , hot with embarrassment while Lucy 's eyes flashed in the moonlight and a smile played on her lips . <newline> <newline> `` Well , if that 's what he 's into , I guess . C'mon , let 's catch up . '' She dashed around me and squeezed through the gap between the gate and I noticed everyone had moved ahead while we 'd had our short exchange . I looked up at the gate before passing through . *The old Arkham Mental Hospital ... Closed down fifty years ago once they investigated the place for abuse of the patients . Who knows what we 'll find in-* A voice calling for me to hurry up interrupted my thought . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell ? '' I muttered before running to catch up to the group . Jake and Steven shoved into the front door , pushing all their weight to force it open as I arrived . The door ground against the floor of the foyer , sending a shower of dust into the air as it scraped against the tiles . We all squeezed through and Steven produced flashlights from a bag I had n't noticed him carrying . <newline> <newline> `` In case we decide to split up , we 'll each have a light . '' Steven passed them around and flicked his on , shining it under his chin to cast strange shadows over his face . `` Are we ready to descend into *unknown HORRORS BELOW ... '' * He spoke with an inflection like Dracula , throwing his voice around the halls around us in a gloomy echo . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's just move on , dork , '' Cindy teased , shoving him playfully . He chuckled and we began our trek , wandering the halls aimlessly . After checking a dozen rooms with no impressive findings , Cindy sighed . `` This is boring , '' she mumbled . <newline> <newline> `` Well , this place is abandoned . What did you expect ? '' Steven replied . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know , something exciting , I guess . I heard there were like , tunnels connecting to the sewer in this place . '' <newline> <newline> `` Where the hell did you hear that Cind ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know . I heard some of them go straight to the bay . Why do n't we look for those ? '' <newline> <newline> She looked at Steven expectantly and he scanned the hallway before nodding . `` Ca n't hurt . How do we find these tunnels ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know . '' Cindy shined her light down the hall in both directions while Jake began flashing his into different rooms . <newline> <newline> `` Where did Emily go ? '' He asked . I looked around but there was no sign of her . <newline> <newline> `` What ? Where did she go ? '' I repeated Jake 's question . <newline> <newline> `` I bet she 's trying to scare us . '' <newline> <newline> `` Is n't that your job , Steve ? '' Cindy remarked , smirking at him . <newline> <newline> `` You 're right . Em , you 're not allowed to scare us ! '' Steve called , cupping his mouth with his hands . `` That 's my jo- '' A shrill scream interrupted him , freezing all of us in place . We shined our lights in unison down the hall toward the source of the scream . they all converged on a broken flashlight , smashed on the floor . Jake sprinted down the hall and we followed , Jake shouting Emily 's name . <newline> <newline> `` Jake , she 's probably just screwing with us , '' Steven said as we caught up to him . He was kneeling by the broken flashlight , staring at fresh blood stain spattered on the floor around the flashlight . We heard another scream cut short by a deafening *boom* and Jake bolted down the hall , screaming his sister 's name . I followed him and stopped short at the sound of commotion behind me . Steven was curled up on the floor , cradling his knee . `` I tripped . Do n't sweat it , just find Emily . '' His expression was contorted with pain but with Cindy at his side , I decided to grab Lucy 's hand and pull her along with me after Jake . <newline> <newline> I tried following his cries for Emily but eventually the echoes were playing with my ears as they rolled in from every direction . Lucy seemed turned around as well , spinning as she tried to discern where Jake might 've went . `` Did you see where he ran ? '' I asked . Lucy just shook her head , her eyes wide with fear . `` Maybe we should go back and get Steven ? '' <newline> <newline> Lucy was about to speak when we heard Jake 's voice again , this time clearly coming from down some stairs up ahead . I pointed the light down the stairs , the winding staircase walled with bricks as it headed underground . `` Maybe these lead to the tunnels Cindy was talking about ? '' Lucy said , tugging my sleeve . `` Maybe Emily went into the sewers . '' <newline> <newline> `` Went or was taken ? '' Lucy stared at me with a frightened look and I pt a hand on her shoulder . `` Sorry , I 'm just scared . Let 's go back and find Steve and Cindy . '' <newline> <newline> `` What about the stairs ? What if we get lost and ca n't find them again ? '' I studied the staircase for a second before taking my flashlight and placing it on the ground , pointing it the way we 'd come . <newline> <newline> `` There . When we see the light , we 'll know . '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know how I feel about that idea . '' Lucy handed me her flashlight and looked back down at the one I 'd placed on the floor . <newline> <newline> `` It 'll be fine , let 's just go . '' We retraced our footsteps back the way we 'd come , hoping we 'd remembered all those twists and turns . I was just beginning to think we were lost when I stepped on something round that nearly made me slip and fall . I pointed the light down to see Emily 's flashlight where we 'd left it . Steven and Cindy were nowhere to be found . <newline> <newline> `` Where are they ? '' Lucy demanded , the fear in her voice more than noticeable . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't freak out . Maybe they left to get help . C'mon , let 's see if they 're outside . '' We trudged back to the entrance , a straight shot down the hallway we 'd first come down . However , upon reaching the foyer , we hit a dead end on an empty wall . `` What the fuck ? '' I dragged the light over the wall 's surface , trying to locate the entrance . The wall was blank , no windows , doors , or paint . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand , this is where we came from . Where the hell did the door go ? '' I heard the sound of something rolling on the floor and turned to see another busted flashlight as it tapped my shoe . I pointed my light down the hallway and spotted a shape disappear around the corner where we 'd found Emily 's flashlight . <newline> <newline> `` Did you see that ? '' I demanded . <newline> <newline> `` See what ? '' Lucy cried , grasping my shirt . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck , I do n't know , '' my voice exposing my own fear . `` Let 's find a door . Okay ? '' I started walking along the wall , but the halls ended with rooms filled with broken cupboards and rotting tables . There were no other doors and I had n't remembered seeing another entrance when we 'd entered . With a sigh of resignation , I pointed the light back down the hallway , spotting nothing around the corner . `` We have to find Jake . '' <newline> <newline> `` What about Steve and Cindy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Maybe they went after Jake and we missed 'em ... '' I was rubbing the stubble on my chin , sweat pouring down my neck when I remembered Cindy 's words . `` The sewers . We could find them and then get out through the sewers . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? Why do n't we find an *actual* door or get out through a window ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I think all the windows are up on the higher floors , and none of these rooms go anywhere . We 'd have to go down that hallway anyways to keep searching . '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess ... '' Lucy followed me down the hallway , both of us huddled close together . As we followed our original flight after Jake , we approached the lit up hallway , the light blinking out as we rounded the corner . Upon turning , we both froze , my flashlight beam illuminating Steven 's torso moments before he was dragged down the stairs screaming , vanishing in the dark . <newline> <newline> -- - </s>\n","<s>[INST] No one ever does .

Who are you ? How do you craft your home ? [/INST] Swordbow . Patron deity of creative destruction . He Who Reaches Both Near and Far . <newline> <newline> These are monikers given to me after I became a god . I was originally an archer who won several skirmishes using his sidearm . My ascension came upon felling an awakened demon by the letter of the legendary law , but not the spirit ; no one said I could n't use kamikaze squirrels , after all . Befitting my station , I was given a small pocket dimension by a quorum of the Pantheon . I used it as a canvas to express my divine portfolio . <newline> <newline> The sky is always blue during the day , and the full moon always out during the night . My pocket dimension has what I call the Infinite Breezy Meadow , with emerald grass and hills as far as the eyes can see . It is not infinite , of course , and the closed space will loop back . In the 'center ' lies my maze fortress , lovingly called the Psychorena . Half of it is an actual castle , with hidden passageways and everyone not bolted down can be used as a weapon . However , it can be difficult to tell where the architecture ends and nature begins . Taking cues from the elves , I 've blended the two . What would normally be a hall nexus would instead be a clearing . Groves are fed by brooks which , if someone were to turn into a fish or otter , lead to hidden treasure rooms and armories , and allow access to the fortress in ways that the hallways do not . <newline> <newline> After all , what kind of battle god would I be if I privileged only knights in full armor ? Rogues and clever animagi need love too . <newline> <newline> People with longstanding grudges can put down artifacts and gold as collateral , and fight it out in my domain . I have found that death can make people cautious , but a `` no pain '' rule also encourages recklessness that suppresses creativity . While death is n't permanent unless they want it to be , I 've certainly amped up the pain quotient to keep things interesting . The Prime Material Plane seems to privilege mages who wield fire and lightning , as well as heroes with enchanted weapons . Again , I am the Patron Deity of Creative Destruction . Such tactical convergence and complacency are ill-suited to my playground . <newline> <newline> I also allow for spectators , who enjoy the floating grove fruits that I cultivate , as well as the entertainment . Why , last week there was one very interesting battle . One animagus turned an archer into an oyster , then turned into an otter and ferreted them both through the waterways into the treasure room . Stumbling upon the rare Blast Arrows , they then waited until the mercs were directly above them before exploding everything down to the Bottomless Chasm , and sending the mercenaries to their doom . <newline> <newline> Had it not been for the animagus turning into a giant spider , both of them would 've died . This tactic was certainly only possible due to their combined skills and daring . Exquisite ! They went home rich that day , while the knights spent a week in my Trap Labyrinth until they developed a better danger sense . <newline> <newline> Would you like to try your luck ? </s>\n","<s>[INST] `` What does n't kill me has made a tactical error . '' [/INST] Dear Anna , <newline> <newline> I started writing this letter to you a while ago . This is probably the best truth that can come out of such a letter . <newline> <newline> A year ago I decided to put in the paperwork and have the company participate in the Erasmus+ programme . I did this without proper permission . Even though I wasn ’ t given the red immediately , my red-green light soon turned yellow . <newline> <newline> The application was a rather struggle-free process and soon CVs were flowing in . For a while , I took it for what it was , my responsibility . It started by reading and responding to each and every CV , first in an engaging way and less along the way . In the beginning I had my “ rockstars ” separated from the rest of the children and different subs under my basic intern categories . It was a system with some level of complication , but not as complicated as some of the external factors weighing in . My anticipated results were dubbed by the Management as indifferent to our sense of urgency and unrealistic . <newline> <newline> The Management often accuses me of that . So unless you prove me otherwise , I am guilty as charged . <newline> <newline> My project was dead pretty much by the time I started bulking the incoming into lesser categories and more pages of uread mails . Then , one day , I felt my mailbox heavy , loaded with crap , so I deleted hundreds of Spam , and my ‘ INTERNS ’ mega-folder . I can ’ t remember when was this or how much time had passed up until your email , which I opened and scanned quickly – thought : maybe – responded professionally sending you the job ’ s description and that was it . Our communication began . <newline> <newline> You needed the credits , I needed the staff . My decision was based on my sense of urgency , which unlike what the Management likens to believe , derives from our collective sense of urgency . For a whole week I struggled with the idea and attempted to overcome this struggle by writing a letter to you . This letter was lingering in stchara @ gmail.com drafts from April 2nd ( on the day I was given your official notification of acceptance ) until April 9th when I deleted my convoluted , lectury , self-apprehensive Draft for a oneliner : “ Yes you may start and end your training a week earlier or later , just let me know what your travelling plan is once you know exactly. ” <newline> <newline> This is what I told the Management in my quest for the Green Light : the language you speak and that we need you . That the programme will pay for everything , not one-cent needs to come out of our pocket if we don ’ t want it to . Yes , we have a responsibility to train her not teach her . There are no lessons loaded in exercises , all the learning is in the observation . But while I think such things now , during the first week of April I was going through some agony about your case . If you remember , I eventually talked about it with you , not to deprive you of expectations but things to anticipate . My guilt of all time has been that I should have given you the benefit of a doubt earlier on , before your official acceptance . Our brief break in communication between the end of March and beginnings of April – those 10 days – made me assume that we had more in-between time . The the job description would have been our kickstart for conversation , not the seal of approval . <newline> <newline> I know for a fact that this is not an interesting position and that no one , in our office at least , can teach you this as a career . There is no Wolf of Wallstreet roaming our office halls , just tumbleweed , silence and my dog . By the time we had our first Skype conversation it felt too late to mention broken machines and family rows , but I did it anyway and for some time it calmed me down . <newline> <newline> I ’ ve wonder if by resolving my worries I placed more burden on your shoulders . I ’ ve wondered if that Skype conversation should have happened first or at all . I ’ ve wondered if I ’ m emotionally or otherwise capable to handle a new co-worker/trainee . The first thing you will learn in our office is that “ No ” is the rightful answer to all questions . The next thing you will learn is that “ Yes ” is always the least affordable . <newline> <newline> Everything is situational , including ourselves and this relationship we are about to embark on . When I re-read your CV on April 2nd , I realised you were much more complex , beyond your language and your business degree , with publications on gender inequality in the labour market and state-led innovation systems . I saw in you my passion for education . I found an ally . That ’ s when accepting you became as much exciting as it was hard for me . Nothing could betray such doubts in my answer . Even if later on I exposed these thoughts to you , seeking to resolve my conscious inhibitions and to provide you with the right to an exit from a shithole , I did it because there was still time . Time is all there is , to say No and to say Yes , in everything . <newline> <newline> Here ’ s what ’ s funny . When I gave up on pursuing the Programme , the Programme didn ’ t know about it . When I decided to act on my pursuit , the Management didn ’ t know about it . Your letter of approval was as short as the time of discussion I had with others about it and so I went with it . I write to you today with my basic worries unaffected , nothing has changed except one : time ripens . <newline> <newline> You are hear to train and I am here to learn . You will train yourself while working with little or nothing , the same resources that teach me how to take responsibility . <newline> <newline> Time ripens . </s>\n","<s>[INST] A genie will grant you one wish .

A superhero ? So many things I had wanted so long ago . My eyes were watering now , and tears streamed down my face . Finally , when I could take no more , I squeezed them shut . <newline> <newline> There was a great rush of air , and all was silent . Things were different . I could feel it in my bones , from my nose to my tail . <newline> <newline> I flicked open one set of eyelids , and then the other , and cast my gaze around my city . People stared at me in awe and alarm . Cell phones were slowly raised , photos and videos taken . Someone started screaming , and the crowd began to move outward , flowing away from me in terror . Police officers ran toward me or away at random , some deciding that their pay-grade just was not high enough to deal with the present situation . I ignored the officers and their guns as I spread my great wings and left the surface . The winds from my escape shattered windows and floored those who had chosen to remain . As I soared higher , I let you a great gout of flame ahead of me . <newline> <newline> I was a motherfucking dragon , and that 's the way it was meant to be . </s>\n","<s>[INST] You are the oldest inhabitant of Hell .

[/INST] He hit the snooze button on the alarm twice to silence its sadistic horn . As he laid back down , his hand grazed over the orange bottle , unmoved from where he left it a week and a half ago . He let out a deep sigh with his eyes closed . The alarm and it 's rush of consciousness washed out whatever directions his subconscious wrote him , like high tide to a message in the sand . If he stared long enough into the abyss of his eyelids he could make out a few letters here and there , but the light of the waking world would wash away all of it soon enough . It was nice just to have the ability to dream again , even if the dreams were n't the best . It was nice to have a relationship with his subconscious again . Order is organized but chaos is beautiful . <newline> <newline> Still , the sleep world called him . He could hear some faint sound of warning echoing up from the depths of his grey matter . It 's tone matched the overcast sky , like that of a mother weeping over her lost child . The air of the waking world was thick and ominous . The silence a deep trough awaiting a crest of contrast . The ocean of awareness was sucking in an undertow , compounding itself into a wave that could crush him into sand or carry him to the shore . Sanity is calm but mania is alive . <newline> <newline> He resisted the urge for more sleep and stood up at the foot of his bed . Another aimless day with no plans to be made . The 12 hours of waking time that lay ahead seemed to make finite an infinite amount of dull nothingness . Today was a different one than yesterday . He knew that much , but that was more than he had known for a long time . 2 weeks ago every day felt the same . The clouds that blocked the sky once made up a fog that he lived in , day in and day out . Over the past week they had lifted from him to the sky . Soon , the sun would melt them away and rid them from his existence . He hoped . The light is warm but darkness is soothing . <newline> <newline> He walked into the kitchen and surveyed his options . No coffee . Watch the amount of sugar . Even gluten was encroaching into the category of possible disturbances . He played by their rules with an apathetic conformity . They liked to act like they knew what was going on , but no one really did . He was developing a good picture , he just had to make sure not to lose himself in the darkroom . This week and a half was the first break from the script he could muster , and he erased words and rewrote lines in light pencil , not daring to use a pen yet . He left the kitchen with the same empty hands and empty soul as he had entered with . <newline> <newline> He approached the bathroom with a sense of apprehension . The air was thicker here . The silence a deafening pitch of white noise . The weeping voice called out from where he 'd left it in his bed with each step closer he took , the only noise to pierce the screaming silence . Two steps from his bathroom door , he looked back at his bed and could almost make out the veiled mistress that pleaded for him . His animal curiosity sparked embers of interest in his otherwise lifeless eyes as his brain automatically attempted to make sense of the world by assigning causes and effects , but the dullness of his waking life turned blunt any blade attempting to arouse his mind . He knew himself well enough to identify the source of the silence and the shrieks without any effort . It had been long since he last lost himself , but he could stand apart from it now . That was the difference this time . <newline> <newline> He stood and soaked in the shrieks like rays of sunshine , breathing in their hidden music like a grove of lavender . She screamed louder at that . Their was a desperation to her pitch - a desperation of potential failure . Whatever her aim , his taking pleasure in her presence made her increase intensity , but his awareness at this slowly weakened her cries . A smile crawled up his cheeks , turning down the volume with each wrinkle of skin until she washed into the white noise . A full grin spread across his face now . It feels good to be alive again , does n't it ? <newline> <newline> He approached the bathroom door with a newfound sense of control . The crest awaited him . As he looked into the mirror , a maniacal slant took over his grin . <newline> <newline> Welcome back <newline> <newline> Back ? I never left . I knew you would reawaken me eventually . We 're soulmates . You ca n't walk away from your soulmate <newline> <newline> Soulmate ? Interesting . I do n't think I 've ever thought of it like that . <newline> <newline> Oh but it 's just the best way to see it ! Do n't you think ? We just go so well together . <newline> <newline> You 're right , I do think we make a great pair . <newline> <newline> See ? Oh I knew you would come around eventually ! I told you not to trust those damn doctors and experts - oh they think they 're so smart <newline> <newline> Yeah , yeah.. Those pills did n't help too much . They did stop you from hurting me though <newline> <newline> Hurting you ? Oh no - I would never ! That was punishment , by your own hand - do n't you remember ? You need to listen to me , I know best . <newline> <newline> You know best ? <newline> <newline> Oh but of course ! Do n't you think ? You just said that before - we 're soulmates , remember ? I know best so you know best , that 's how this works ! You just need to make sure you listen to me.. To save you from yourself ... You 're sick , remember ? <newline> <newline> I 'm sick ? I do n't have a cough , or a fever ... <newline> <newline> Oh hahaha no , no no - sick in the head , remember ? You 're damaged and hurt , that 's why I 'm here ! I know best . Let me help you . <newline> <newline> The clouds from the overcast started to sink with the weight of rain . The rumblings of thunder came from their depths with a ravenous hunger . <newline> <newline> His head started to hurt as the shrieks came back from the room . <newline> <newline> Yes . I know best . Let me help and make this all go away . This is why I 'm here.. <newline> <newline> No . No no no . NO ! NO , you are a crutch ! You 're not here to help , you 're here to hurt the world for me ! You 're here for revenge , revenge for an unfair world ! <newline> <newline> Ooh I like this passion in your voice ! Give me your fire ! Show me the rage that burns in our soul ! The maniacal grin returned and a shadow reached down from his brow to cover his eyes . <newline> <newline> The thunder consumed the clouds and winds rocked the bathroom . A tornado tried to rip him from the earth . The shrieks increased in intensity and threatened the sliver of peace he clung to . <newline> <newline> No.. No ... <newline> <newline> He remembered the control he had before entering the bathroom . He remembered the music hidden in her voice , the beauty of the chaos in his mind . He remembered how his smile deafened her cries and made her cry out more , made her cry out in desperation . There was a reason this day felt different . He brought something back with him from his subconscious , a piece of himself that had won their last confrontation , a piece of himself that he had buried in the fog of medication . If he wanted sunlight , he would need to emit it himself . <newline> <newline> I am done with you . My world is a product of my own creation , and you no longer have a place in this . <newline> <newline> And he closed his eyes and silently hummed to himself a frequency that arose from within . And as he hummed a smile crawled across his face . And as he hummed the shrieks of the woman took on a musical melody . And as he hummed the screams from the maniacal mirror faded into white noise . <newline> <newline> When he opened his eyes , sunlight broke through the clouds . </s>\n","<s>[INST] You walk up to a beggar to give him a dollar bill when he looks directly into your eyes . You realize the old man is Santa Claus . [/INST] It was a simple request , but I was annoyed . I had to go out of my way on my walk home to go to the store and get eggnog . I don ’ t even like eggnog . I have to go an extra five block , and I hate this part of town . It ’ s funny how much difference there is between here and where I live less than half a mile away . It ’ s bad enough that I had to work a full day on Christmas Eve ; I just have to get this over with . I love my wife , I love my new son , but it ’ s cold , and I don ’ t like eggnog . <newline> <newline> “ Excuse me , sir. ” I heard a voice say . I know it came from below me and I cringed . I wanted to ignore it , but I slowed to a shuffle and glanced down . I saw the dirty brown coat sprinkled with snow and I saw the sign . It said , “ Ho Ho Homeless , something for the helpless ? ” I stopped as I read it , smiled then frowned . He continued , “ May I have a dollar sir ? ” I wondered what he would do with it if I gave him one , or a few . He certainly didn ’ t look like he needed any food . He was quite portly , and I would be surprised if he could get up without help . <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know what came over me , I usually just keep walking , but I caught a glimpse of his eyes from below his hood , and a twinkle seemed to shine brightly off of rosy cheeks . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s Christmas you know , ” I said without thinking , “ don ’ t you have any family to be with ? ” It was rude I realized right after I said it . But he didn ’ t seem to be bothered by the question . He tilted his head further up to look at me , raised his hands and swept the hood from his head . His hair was brilliantly white and complimented fully by the beard that had seemed to come out of nowhere . I was not sure anymore what upon him was hair or the snow that slowly began to fall . <newline> <newline> “ Oh I have family , ” he said with a smile , “ The entirety of humanity is my family , and I feel quite close to them when I ’ m out here . I can ’ t be with them all the time , in fact far less than I would like . I cherish the time I get to be with my brothers and sisters. ” <newline> <newline> I was taken aback . This was the most I ’ ve ever spoken to a homeless person before , and to get such an answer to my question was unexpected . I thought for what seemed like a very long time , but he looked up at me with patience and intense interest . I had to make this good . <newline> <newline> “ Why would you choose to be out in the cold ? ” It wasn ’ t that good . <newline> “ Ho , he he , ha , ahh this isn ’ t cold at all for me. ” He replied , and it was true , the coat he wore looked more like it was for show than warmth . “ What are you doing here , you live on the other side of town don ’ t you ? ” <newline> <newline> He was right , I didn ’ t look like I belonged in this part of town . “ I ’ m picking up some eggnog from the store , it ’ s a special kind I guess , and I need to come over here to get it. ” I continued , “ What are you doing here if you have family to be with ? ” <newline> <newline> “ When I work , ” the man explained , “ I am neck deep in paperwork . I see many people , but it ’ s easy to lose touch with humanity . I may be busy , but it ’ s nice to come out here and see what real good looks like once in awhile . I ’ m happy to say that I ’ m never disappointed. ” <newline> <newline> I shuffled a bit and put my hand in my pocket . I had a five dollar bill and I presented it to him . He waved it off and explained , “ To stop and talk to me this night is far more valuable to me than money , and your intention to be so kind warms my heart. ” He smiled and began shuffling around with his things . Packing to move on to a more populated spot I imagined . <newline> <newline> “ Would you like to come over to my house for dinner ? ” The words were out of my mouth before I had the chance to think , but when I did process what I said , I realized I meant it . From the bottom of my heart I wished that he would take me up on my offer . He stood up so quickly and easily that I thought he would bound the building we were next to . <newline> <newline> He placed his hand on my shoulder , and with the most earnest look in his eyes responded , “ Thank you so very much for the invitation . If it were any other night I would be delighted , but I am afraid I have a very pressing engagement I must attend to tonight. ” I must have looked disappointed because he quickly added , “ There ’ s a good chance I ’ ll stop by later though. ” I smiled , and it felt like the most genuine smile I ’ ve had since my son was born . I heard a bell ring in the distance and as I turned to look I saw a deer walk across the street and turn the corner towards the park . I ’ ve lived in the city a long time and I ’ ve never seen any wildlife aside from the occasional raccoon . <newline> <newline> “ Ah , my ride is here ” he said . We both chuckled as he collected his belongings . There wasn ’ t much , a blanket , the sign , and what looked like the remnants of a quart of milk . With hands all full he began to walk away , turning before he went . “ I wish you and your new family , Mary and Joey a very merry Christmas. ” I said it back to him quickly , with a smile and watched as he turned the corner towards the park . I heard in the distance carolers and started humming along and began the long walk home . I didn ’ t even mind now for some reason . The cold didn ’ t bite so hard and the snow was soft and fluffy . I wanted to build a snowman , go sledding , drink hot cocoa and be with my family . I couldn ’ t wait to share those things with Joey when he was older . “ With Joey , ” I said to myself then realized . I had never given that man my family members names . How could he know that ? I kept walking and thinking that perhaps I had , maybe I just forgot from it being such a surprise encounter . <newline> <newline> I made it home at a brisk pace and was happy to shake off my jacket , feel the warmth of being inside , and see the lights of the Christmas tree my wife decorated . When I heard her voice though I was filled with dread . “ Hi honey , welcome home ! ” She called from the kitchen . At that moment I realized I had forgotten the eggnog . The entire reason I had gone out of my way , and I had forgotten all about it . I pulled off my bag morosely and slid it to the ground . As it hit though , it made an odd noise . A sloshing hollow sort of noise . I opened it up to see what it was and found by some miracle a completely new very cold carton of eggnog . As I picked it up , I noticed a note had been placed upon it and in impeccable script was the message , “ Help for the helpless. ” <newline> </s>\n","<s>[INST] You were born on a colonizing spacecraft on your way to a distant star .

Laughing . We were both laughing . Hysterical and strange . In our grassland among the stars . <newline> <newline> Nothing ever changed in those days . When we did n't have class , we swam in those great , cratered tubs of salted water and fought to hold our breath as we swam against the pressure in our limbs , descending towards a bottom we would never reach . Exhausted , we would splay ourselves like aimless star bodies floating gently in the still water , the enormous cannon bulbs above buzzing lightly as they rotated ever so slowly , washing every last corner with their warming gaze . <newline> <newline> No new buildings . No new toys or tricks or gadgets . There was a lethargy to life that none of us seemed to recognize , but all of us felt . We marched as our world marched - straight and steady , towards a marked destination we could not see and yet could not avoid . <newline> <newline> Powerless . Perhaps that was the feeling . After all , we had all awoken as passengers , in a way . None of us alive then had chosen to begin the journey . None of us would live to see the journey end .

We will be fine . '' <newline> <newline> `` Everything is already made , '' said Calla . `` The path is chosen . We are no better than the lion . Trapped in our comforts by people who no longer exist . '' <newline> <newline> `` Such is the way , '' I said , philosophical and ignorant . `` There 's nothing we can do . '' <newline> <newline> Calla hugged me tightly , squeezing my leg between hers . `` Why ? Why ca n't we pick our own path ? '' <newline> <newline> I laughed , more nervous than amused . `` What ? How would we ? *Ceres* is pointed directly at our new home world . That is where we must go . '' <newline> <newline> `` But it *isn't* our new home world , is it ? '' said Calla . `` And not our children 's . And not their children 's . It is the world of strangers . *For* strangers . *Ceres* is our home . Why can we not make of it what we wish ? '' <newline> <newline> I had no answers then . I never had any answers . And that is how I lost Calla . Every unanswered question pulling us further apart . <newline> <newline> We stayed together for those first few years . We were promised to each other . We were promised to our work and our home . We kept those promises . But the dissatisfaction in Calla 's eyes grew only wider and more pronounced . And my sadness and ennui was not enough to match her anger and frustration . <newline> <newline> She found like-minded allies . They met in secret . She did not invite me . And some days she did not come home at all . <newline> <newline> I lost her long before she disappeared . <newline> <newline> All I know is rumor and hearsay , but the whispers were this : that a group of dissidents attacked the control room . They tried to take control of *Ceres* . To plot their own course . To where - who could know ? <newline> <newline> Was Calla a part of this coup attempt ? I do n't know . I hope not . I hope she is still alive somewhere on *Ceres* . I hope she has found some measure of peace . But I do n't know . <newline> <newline> I still visit the savanna when time permits , but I have not swam in those bucket oceans for many years now . It is too painful . Though I like to think that one day I will return . One day Calla and I will both return and we will swim to the bottom .

It was a very old and very common specimen , dating back from his early days as a merchant . Its material was composed of a common fabric used in ordinary carpets , and the design was not something to brag about . While it held some sentimental value , it was not something he was particularly fond of . <newline> <newline> So why was the king taking his time to examine and appraise it ? <newline> <newline> `` This carpet would make a fine addition to my collection , '' remarked the king . `` How much for it ?

But if I may ask , what do you see in the carpet that is not in the others ?

Eventually they lifted off and were riding into the sunrise . The silhouette of the sleigh , body trailing behind , added a nice touch . As I was starting to go inside the reindeer lost control . Of course . I killed their navigator . They lost control and crashed into the neighbors house down the street and exploded . I didnt like john anyway . I 'm pretty sure my son is actually his .

You pride yourself on defending your hoard from the greatest warriors in the world . It makes you all the more annoyed then when the knights that have been coming to slay you seem to be getting more and more inept . [/INST] The tournament should have been the greatest idea I ’ ve ever had . <newline> <newline> I mean , I ’ ve said that about a lot of my ideas , I know . But … they ’ re all really good ideas . <newline> <newline> It used to be - ages ago - that my mere presence was enough to entice the finest and bravest to try their luck against me . As it should be . There ’ s only really one reason anyone wants to be a knight , and that ’ s to beat other people into a pulp . And a Dragon is the biggest damn thing to fight there is . <newline> <newline> And I ’ m one of the biggest Dragons there is . <newline> <newline> I mean - I don ’ t want to imply that *every* knight came to fight me . Oh no - I was a select choice . My hoard was - and still is - fantastic . Culled from the finest treasures . Statuary and art from history ’ s greatest civilizations . Gold coins in requisite mounds . Crystal and diamond goblets and jewelry . Hell , I employ gnomes just to keep it clean , indexed , and polished , to get the perfect shine from the cavern mouth . <newline> <newline> I have *standards* . <newline> <newline> I dedicated a wall of my cavern to recording the deeds of the heroes I vanquished . Their houses , names , sigils , banners - noted and displayed . I am not some *barbarian* who just burns his foes and eats them whole . I truly value those who make their way to my cave to challenge me . I treat them with honor and respect , as is traditional and right . <newline> <newline> But lately… <newline> <newline> I mean - there were always those idiots who thought they were better than they were , and I usually just put them out of their misery . A few I just straight sent home - I have no desire to roast some kid making a bad choice , or a vassal who ’ d been ordered to by some fat noble . Those made me the angriest . There was one time - I actually paid the poor farmer a bag of gold in exchange for his liege-lord ’ s name and address after the asshole dressed him up in cheap mail and ordered him up my mountain under threat of killing his wife and children . Scorched 250 acres in one breath taking that fat bastard out . But I digress . <newline> <newline> I ’ m just saying , I have standards . And I thought , once upon a time , that everyone else did too . <newline> <newline> I mean - don ’ t get me wrong . I *am* evil . I ’ m quite good at it . I try to be fair , but let ’ s face it , when your hobbies consist of flambéing cattle , kidnapping maidens , and ransacking castles for treasure , you ’ re not a force of good in the world . But it balanced , and they all knew what it takes to stop me . I am not immortal - just very , very hard to kill . <newline> <newline> I guess I noticed first maybe , oh , fifteen years ago ? Twenty ? It probably happened before that , but there ’ s dry spells . You take out the finest knights of one generation , you have to wait for the next generation to grow up and desire revenge . But this bunch - seriously . I don ’ t think they even care . They walk up to my cave , issue an *incredibly* poorly-worded challenge ( who is teaching these children to write ! ) and die without so much as denting a scale . It ’ s the same houses , the same family names . Their ancestry is writ on my walls in probably more careful detail than they themselves maintain in their own records . Some of these twits can barely lift a sword ! <newline> <newline> I mean - it ’ s a matter of respect . <newline> <newline> But anyway . The tournament . So at first I suspected another dragon had horned in on my territory . I took a solid year searching to the limits of my range , but not so much as a hatchling had invaded . After that , I thought maybe it was my own fault - had I finally killed off the best and brightest ? Had I so decimated the human population that this *was* the best I could come up with ? <newline> <newline> To my horror , I found that , no . There were still knights , just as many as there had always been . The little kingdoms that I terrorized were just as prolific and intelligent . They just no longer bothered to come after me . Instead , I got the rejects . The wanna-bes . The losers . The rest of the knights were playing *politics* , getting involved in wars and border disputes and righting wrongs and fulfilling ancient prophecies and - basically - not Dragon Slaying . <newline> <newline> For a while I just refused admittance to anyone that came up to my cave but that got boring . There ’ s only so many topics of conversation one can have with a gnome . I toyed with one-shotting them as they rode up the mountainside - a breath of fire out of nowhere - and it was fun for a while , but ultimately , unsatisfying . I thought about increasing my cattle-mutilation and maiden-kidnapping , but decided if it hadn ’ t been enough to attract the finest warriors before , it wasn ’ t likely to work… unless I went all-out . <newline> <newline> Of course I have human servants too . Through them I spent months working on my master plan . A Tournament . An inter-kingdom , prestigious tournament . Bags of gold and hands of fair maidens for the winners . It took several years to build up , but when it finally gained the size and recognition I wanted - it was glorious . Every single noble family for hundreds of miles attended . The festivities went on for a solid week . Every single king and his entourage was there . I actually started to take a lot of pride and interest in this little project - it was a fun diversion . <newline> <newline> Like building a sand castle before you stomp on it . <newline> <newline> And stomp I did . At the ten-year celebration . The final night ’ s awards ceremony . I was actually nervous , leading up to it . And then - oh , the glory . I timed my approach to appear over the horizon right at sunset , flying directly out of the sun . My first breath lit the treetops and flags - a precision shot . My second lit a ring of fire around the entire grounds - a circumference of miles . Of course , I left a little room to escape - no point in a grand showing if nobody ’ s around to tell the tale afterwards . In face , I specifically singled out every bard , storyteller , and entertainer so that they remained as undamaged as I could manage . <newline> <newline> Oh , how they screamed . For the first time in so many years , I had their undivided attention . <newline> <newline> Of course they didn ’ t fight me there . Airborne , a surprise attack , their tournament grounds , tents , and buildings burning around them ? They ran , and died . I boiled them alive in their armor . I bit them in half . I festooned horse entrails from the flagpoles . I even seized an honest-to-god princess to take back with me , right out of her father ’ s protective arms . <newline> <newline> And then I waited . With the hoard gleaming , the princess caged , their lands burning and desecrated , I waited . <newline> <newline> And do you know what they did ? <newline> <newline> NOTHING . THAT IS WHAT THEY DID . <newline> <newline> For a solid month . Not one knight . Not one attack . Not even a strongly-worded note . <newline> <newline> I finally couldn ’ t stand it any longer , and one night , let the princess out of the cage to talk . <newline> <newline> Why ? I demanded . <newline> <newline> She explained that dragon-slaying , which was an erroneous term as nobody had ever actually *slain* me was outdated . The kingdoms had learned to account for the loss of their cattle and fields occasionally and factored that into their economic plans . The extreme patriarchy decided that knights were far less expendable than maidens , and since I only took unmarried virgins ( STANDARDS ) , the easiest way to avoid losing daughters was to marry them off as fast as possible . <newline> <newline> They actually liked having me around ! I drove off other dragons and even kept large predators out of my range . It was something of an honor to have your possessions looted for my hoard ; some noble families kept track of how often I “ visited ” them and used it at a status symbol ! One of the kingdoms had declared my cavern and hoard a “ historical treasure ” . <newline> <newline> They felt I did them a favor by eliminating knights too stupid or short-sighted to try to fight me . I was an asset to the kingdoms . I was an icon . I was practically a god . <newline> <newline> How ? I asked her . I eat you . I kill your children . I kidnap your sisters and daughters . I burned you ! <newline> <newline> But you ’ re a good person , she said sincerely . You spare the poor and hungry . You kill the rich and mean . You never unfairly burden anyone . The tournament - they 'd figured out I hosted it each year - it was so unexpected . She was confused , and thought maybe I was n't feeling well or they 'd upset me somehow , and she was sure her father was confused , but nobody was going to come rescue her because she was sure that I was just going to let her go . <newline> <newline> I didn ’ t . I fried her to a fine crisp and snacked on princess jerky for the rest of the night . But it got me thinking - and I finally hit on my mistake . <newline> <newline> *That fucking farmer* . <newline> <newline> So I think I ’ ve decided it ’ s time to move on . I ’ ll get rid of the hoard - probably give it away , I ’ m too fond of it to burn it . I ’ ve heard there ’ s an island off the coast that ’ s never even seen a dragon before . Some seaside living might just be the change I need . <newline> <newline> I mean - there ’ s no point in staying someplace where nobody *appreciates* you . <newline> </s>\n","<s>[INST] When the USA finally invaded Canada , it seemed no contest .

[/INST] `` O Canada '' the immortal anthem that will ring from this day forward . The one true anthem of North America was almost quashed as the Americans in the south marched across our borders . They had the weapons , the numbers , and the will to defeat the great northern land . <newline> <newline> Shortly after Donald Trump became president he set his sights on our wonderful maple leafs and majestic moose population . His thirst for the ultimate pancake was unquenchable , and his hatred of poutine was undeniable . The Orange Menace as he became known was formidable , and he commanded his troops with such rigor . <newline> <newline> For two long years we fought the advancing Americans with everything we had . We rode our moose valiantly , but our efforts were in vain . We lined the streets with booby traps of the stickiest maple syrup , but they sent in their special forces comprised of the most morbidly obese men and women the world had ever seen . They ate through the sticky traps and engaged in war tactics now amiably called `` consumed earth policy . '' The threat of total annihilation was so real that we had to call in our final solution ... the geese . <newline> <newline> Now I know what you are thinking , `` that is a war crime of the highest caliber . '' Geese warfare had been outlawed by the 1972 Geneva Convention and for good reason , Geese were merciless . They consumed everything in their path . Their beaks are razor sharp , and not even a tank can stop their powerful claws . But , desperate times calls for desperate measures and if the Americans can use morbidly obese mutants , we could surely use our geese . <newline> <newline> The sky turned white as millions of geese flooded the airways . The obese special forces looked in horror as the thousands of pounds of flesh was ripped from their `` big bones . '' The Americans dropped nukes on us , but the geese only absorbed their power . The geese grew to be the size of a Winnebago and their hunger could not be quelled . In the end , only ten million Americans and three million Canadians survived . Trump was killed in the Goosepocalypse and Justin Trudeau was mistaken for poutine by the obese special forces . <newline> <newline> Both America and Canada were devastated and Mexico became the primary power of North America . They consoled both nations with the most delicious enchiladas ever crafted . The North American Union was established to ensure that neither nation ever engaged in such total war tactics ever again . <newline> <newline> It has been twenty years and the dark times are behind us . Both nations have rebounded , but it 'll never be the same .

The foreman of the jury , with his fisherman 's sweater and white beard , could not escape the familiar scent of garlic , white wine and -- oddly enough , tarragon . The housewife would have sworn the smell was bread rising , mixed with fresh marmalade , while the man with nervous hands and greasy hair could have told you it was pickle relish and fresh tomatoes , so ripe the juice would drip down your hands . They all leant forwards against the barrier , waiting for the judge to come in and the cloche to be lifted so one of them could be proven right . More importantly , so the rest of them could be proven wrong . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> It was universally agreed by almost every food professor , that the dish itself was sacrilegious . It broke every rule in the book . An abomination . *It should not be able to smell like that . * Simply false advertising .

The youngest judge on the bench , Josip 's lawyer had asked for him specifically , most likely for his forgiving nature . His Lordship thought boys would be boys , after all . Lord Carlisle shuddered , ill at ease with the sudden memory . Some pranks had gone a little too far . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Let me taste the food , '' Lord Carlisle said . False advertising be damned , he could not help it . The smell was intoxicating , it begged to be tasted .

[/INST] **The Greatest Warrior** <newline> <newline> The two knights stood opposite each other , on a hillock streaked with mist ; a golden haze in the early morning light . <newline> <newline> Beneath the haze , felled banners lay on dewy grass , dead hands holding them . There were so many -- the Red Horse of House Stayvrick , the Flayed Moon of the House Argold . The Dancing Nudes of House Gorstock , the Fluttering Wings of House Quicktreat . The flags of every major army in Ten Kingdoms , strewn amid rotting corpses . <newline> <newline> The knights were wading through the haze , gold fog coiling about their waists . One of them was limping ; a man in rusty steel , leaning on a halberd to hold him steady . The visor of his helmet was up , to reveal a bruised and beaten face beneath . His blue eyes were the only feature visible amid the mud , blood and grime . <newline> <newline> The other man was fully armoured , in what looked like layers of onyx . His visor down , his face was a gleaming black space . He was eight feet tall with a body thick as an oak tree , and he held a broadsword in one hand . <newline> <newline> During the fray , nobody had been sure whose side the Black Warrior was on . He had simply turned up at the melee , swinging and hacking at anyone in his path .

They were waiting for the last spurts of movement to fade away , so their meal could begin . <newline> <newline> `` Just one thing , '' Sir Gallant gasped , still leaning on his halberd ; swaying now , clearly in no shape to fight . `` Just one thing .

[/INST] I like James , he 's a good friend . <newline> <newline> I remember the first time I met him . We were both at the same teen camp that happens every summer and winter out in Appalachian mountains . He was playing offence , and I was playing defence . A fight broke out between both of our teams , and before anyone knew what had really happened , everyone and anyone throwing punches . And that was the first time I remember seeing him , and unconventionally meeting him . My fist flying into his face . <newline> <newline> Surprisingly though , by the end of the camp we had become best mates . What started out as bitter rivalry after that brawl slowly became a friendly rivalry and then evolved into friendship . In the next few months after camp we ended up hanging out a lot with one another , as my Mum moved to the same town as him . Me and my Mum ended up moving for a bunch of reasons , mainly though 'cause she could n't find work in the other town we were living in . That and there were concerns that a serial killer was loose in the region , preying on mainly teenage boys from high schools . My mum , having suffered sexual abuse at the hands of my father , could never stand the thought of that every possibly happening to me ; so therefore that was the other part of the reason that we had left the last three towns that had young guys disappear in . <newline> <newline> Since we ended up in the same high school , it allowed me and James to catch up whenever we wanted . I still remember the time when we threw fireworks under Principal Miller 's car , or the time when we snuck into the school pool in the middle of the night with some babes . I remember when we stayed up one night just star gazing , next to a shed we had found in the forest , talking about anything and everything . James would often talk about whatever girl he liked at the moment , or the last girl he had sex with , while I sometimes asked him questions like anal sex and blowjobs feels like . <newline> <newline> I still also can remember the first time that I told him that I liked him . He laughed me off , told me that he liked me too and tried to changed subject . <newline> <newline> I just stood there . <newline> <newline> Unamused . <newline> <newline> Perplexed by my silence , he turned around to see me standing there . The look on my face . My sincereness of what I had said . <newline> <newline> And then it dawned on him what I said , or more specifically , what I had meant . <newline> <newline> Lost for words , he quickly excused himself and drove away ; leaving me just standing there . <newline> <newline> Hurt . <newline> <newline> Alone . <newline> <newline> Vulnerable . <newline> <newline> I had opened up to him and he had n't even replied . He just drove away . <newline> <newline> The next few weeks at school were like torture . <newline> <newline> He would n't look at me . <newline> <newline> He would n't talk to me . <newline> <newline> He would n't respond to any of my texts or phone calls . <newline> <newline> And so I planned a way I could make it up to him . Make it up for both of us . <newline> <newline> About a week later I was ready . <newline> <newline> Not wanting to waste any time , I slipped a letter into his locker that morning detailing that I was sorry for what I said and how I just wanted us to be friends again . Furthermore , I also mentioned that I wanted to make it up to him , and therefore that I had a surprise I wanted to give him as a sign of my goodwill in this situation . At the bottom of the letter I had written the where and when The secret shed in the forest - 8pm . <newline> <newline> He must have read the letter pretty soon after I had slipped it in , as less than an hour later I received a text from him simply stating ***Kk , will be there .

Each tick of the clock in class seemed to slow down purposefully , as if to delay our joyous reunion . However , eventually the moment finally came . He arrived at the shed , where I was waiting ; the shed that we had never told any of our friends or family about . I welcomed him , apologised , and gave him a beer from pack that I had brought . I told him that I wanted us to relax before I showed him his surprise , and so we sat down for a good 15 minutes while he had a few beers and I just asked questions about his classes . <newline> <newline> About 10 minutes later , he was gone . My customized beers had done their job . Moving quickly , I carefully dragged him inside the shed and tied him many times to the chair that I had brought . Once securing him , I proceeded to duct tape his hands , mouth and even feet . There would be no escape for him until he fully realised , how much I needed him . And how much he secretly needed me , even though he was n't aware of it . I needed the time to for him to realise this as well , so I took his car keys and drove his car into one of the rivers going through the forest . <newline> <newline> Within the next hour , he woke up . At first he seemed confused . He was trying to shout through the duct tape and break out of chair and ropes . I told him that I was helping him . I told him that I was helping him realise how much he needed me . <newline> <newline> And how much I needed him . <newline> <newline> But he did n't listen . <newline> <newline> Not at first . <newline> <newline> But as the several days between now and then slowly passed by , he began to understand . <newline> <newline> I am with him now , as I write this to all of you . You really should be here too , to be able to see the way that the lovingly way that he looks at me know . To be able to understand all the beautiful ways that we pleasure one another . The kind words he whispers into my ears , even though he has duct tape over his mouth . The empathetic embraces he gives me , even though his arms are still tied behind the chair he sits on . <newline> <newline> He really loves me now <newline> <newline> I can see it in the way that his eyes plead and dart whenever I am in the room . <newline> <newline> And I love him too . <newline> <newline> Just like all those before him . <newline> <newline> <newline> Every day that passes proves truer and truer what I said in the beginning . <newline> <newline> I like James , he 's a good friend . <newline> <newline> _______________________________ <newline> <newline> [ + ] ( https : //www.facebook.com/SamboMoiz ) [ + ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/composerofwords ) [ + ] ( http : //anauthorsadventure.wordpress.com/ ) [ + ] ( http : //www.wattpad.com/user/SamboMoiz ) [ + ] ( https : //twitter.com/SamboMoiz ) [ + ] ( http : //composerofwords.blogspot.co.nz/ ) <newline> </s>\n","<s>[INST] `` not slytherin ... not slytherin ...

You just started a new job in a large office building and what you do n't know is that at twelve o'clock every day , there is a office wide Purge style battle to the death , those who survive an hour

A bell just went off , it 's twelve o'clock . [/INST] As I finished up my research on Alligator breeding habits for a story I was tasked with writing , a bell began to ring loudly throughout the office . I could feel the sound vibrating off the cubicle walls . I looked over my cubicle wall to ask a co-worker what the bell was for . <newline> <newline> I watched as he calmly opened his desk drawer , to reveal a small armory . There were multiple handguns , knives and magazines and other assorted weapons neatly stashed away . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is that for ? '' I questioned loudly , and nervously . <newline> <newline> The man looked me in the eyes , and pointed his handgun at my face . I saw my life flash before my eyes , and could n't understand what circumstances had arisen to put me in this position . I heard the gun fire , and the sound of the shot rang through my ears . <newline> <newline> I heard something hit the ground loudly behind me .

Then , he placed a gun in my hand . <newline> <newline> `` The safety is on , and it 's fully loaded with one in the chamber '' He said , pointing to the safety switch . <newline> <newline> The weapon felt heavy in my hand , I flicked the safety off with my thumb and gripped the gun tightly . <newline> <newline> The man looked down at his watch . `` 45 minutes to go '' </s>\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Open a text file in write mode\n","with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n","    # Iterate through the first 1000 elements\n","    for i in range(1000):\n","        # Extract the 'formatted_text' from each element\n","        formatted_text = test_data[i]['formatted_text']\n","        # Write the text to the file, followed by a newline character\n","        file.write(formatted_text + '\\n')\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fWmetoy3Yc51","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701232911131,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":131,"user":{"displayName":"Afinitus","userId":"12077626470309934133"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]}]}
