We will compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) extensively as an example to study these two topics.\n","\n","## 1. Inductive Bias\n","\n","What is inductive bias? It is the assumption that the learning algorithm makes about the problem domain. Suppose that we build a machine learning system. We want to leverage the specific knowledge about the problem domain to make the learning process **more efficient** and the system **generalize much better** with fewer parameters. Let's be more precise. What do exactly **more efficient** and **generalize much better** mean? The learning process is more efficient 1) if we can learn the model with fewer parameters, 2) if we can learn the model with fewer data, and 3) if we can learn the model with fewer iterations. And the system generalizes much better if the model can generalize to the unseen data well.\n","\n","We have already observed the power of inductive bias. We know that CNN generalizes better than MLP even with the same number of parameters. We partially concluded that is because CNN has the inductive bias that the model is translation invariant. We will study the inductive bias of CNN in more detail in this homework.\n","\n","In this homework, we will use the edge detection task as an example to study the inductive bias of CNN. We will compare CNN and MLP extensively. And we will see when CNN can fail.\n","\n","## 2. Systematic Experimentation in Machine Learning\n","\n","How can we prove our hypothesis that CNN has the inductive bias that the model is translation invariant? We conduct extensive experiments in machine learning research (and other fields) to prove our hypothesis. In this context, systematic experimentation refers to running a series of experiments to prove our hypothesis. In this homework, we will study how to conduct systematic experimentation in machine learning.\n","\n","Let's take a step back and think about 1) what our hypothesis is and 2) what experiments are needed to conduct to prove our hypothesis. The first question is easy. The hypothesis is that CNN has the inductive biases of locality and translational invariance. It is not enough to show that CNN performs better than MLP with the same number of parameters. Then, how do we design the experiments to prove our hypothesis? In this homework, we will design the experiments, conduct the experiments, analyze the results, and draw a conclusion."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"t467mfLPFUXZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import random\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n","import torchvision\n","import torchvision.transforms as T\n","from torchvision.transforms import ToPILImage\n","\n","from PIL import Image\n","from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import rotate\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from copy import deepcopy\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5PezUtDlFUXa"},"source":["### Helper functions\n","\n","The following code cell defines function and classes that will be used in the succeeding codes.

When CNN is Worse than MLP\n","\n","In this problem, we will see that CNN is not always better than MLP in the image domain. Using CNN assumes that the data has locally correlated, whatever data looks. We can manually 'whiten' or remove such local correlation simply by applying random permutation to the images. A random permutation matrix is a matrix that has the same number of rows and columns. Each row and column has the same number of 1s. The rest of the elements are 0s. For example, the following is a random permutation matrix.\n","\n","```\n","[[0, 1, 0, 0],\n"," [0, 0, 0, 1],\n"," [1, 0, 0, 0],\n"," [0, 0, 1, 0]]\n","```\n","\n","This matrix randomly reorders the elements of the vector. For example, if we apply this matrix to the vector `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, we will get `[2, 4, 1, 3]`. If we apply this matrix to the image, we will get the image with the same content, but the pixels are randomly shuffled. One property of the random permutation matrix is that it is invertible. It means that we can recover the original image by simply applying the inverse matrix to the shuffled image. From the information-theoretical perspective, the random permutation matrix preserves the mutual information of the image and the label.\n","\n","We will repeat the same experiment as the previous problem.
